When I write an article, I would title it in the end, after getting all my ideas out. Only then, do we have a better idea of what the article is about. If I write an article with the title in the beginning, it is usually a placeholder just to get my brain working. More often than not, I would end up writing about other concepts that may or may not derive from the initial idea.">

<div class=post-content><p>We are all work in progress.</p>
<p>When I write an article, I would title it in the end, after getting all my ideas out. Only then, do we have a better idea of what the article is about.
If I write an article with the title in the beginning, it is usually a placeholder just to get my brain working.
More often than not, I would end up writing about other concepts that may or may not derive from the initial idea.</p>
<p>So why, do I approach life in a different manner? Why am I fixated to choosing a niche or a specialization? Why am I so determined to stay in this path? Because of the sunk cost? Because it is a good opportunity? Because I am in a place where other people want but couldn&rsquo;t get, so I need to cherish it?</p>
<p>What if I approach life in the same way? Instead of choosing to label myself as a Software QA Engineer. Instead of labelling my niche as ABC. Instead of trying to brand myself as XYZ. I should just go with my curiosity and interests.</p>
<hr>
<p>Why do we need to specialize? Because it is profitable. At least, I think that&rsquo;s why I choose to specialize, to increase my hireability.</p>
<p>Why did I choose to become a QA?</p>
<p>Because I foresee QA as being in higher demand in a few years.</p>
<p>When the market starts to get flooded with new Software Engineers, a strong QA would allow the company to bring in &ldquo;weaker&rdquo; Software Engineers.</p>
<p>By the industry standard that I am aware of, a single QA should be able to handle testing for 3-5 developers. In 3-5 years, I would be a QA Engineer with hands-on experience with testing large scale, distributed software that uses microservices architecture and have a crazy huge number of QPS.</p>
<p>In other words, I am positioning myself to be the a QA that is appealing to start ups, that are transiting into scaling phase. The type of start ups that have just raised series B or C funding.</p>
<p>Another upside of being a QA, is that I will be positioned in a way that would allow my future start up to move quickly. If your code keeps breaking due to introduction of new features, the development progress will always be hindered.</p>

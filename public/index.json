Test ","title":"My 1st post"},{"content":"A social media where people post the negative things that they are feeling, encountering. The pain, the failures, the obstacles.\nA place where people compete on whose life is worse off. And get comforted from seeing people who are in worse state than themselves.\nA place where people seek solace and comfort from others who are sharing the same pain.\nYou know, I think true bonds are forged when you encounter comrade in arms, when you go through a common hardship and overcome the obstacle together.\nIn the modern world, the enemies we face, the battles we fight, are mostly abstract. Enemies like procrastination, self-doubt, depression, fear, desire for a better life. Desire to grow.\n However, given the current state of social media, everyone thinks everyone else is living the perfect ideal life. And as a result, we probably become much more isolated. We ended up fighting our battles alone, because we think others are already winning.\nThis social media, will be a place where people are free to be vulnerable. And in being vulnerable, they will find others who are facing the common enemy. Be it depression, negativity, self-doubt, imposter syndrome, or what\u0026rsquo;s not.\n I\u0026rsquo;m unsure if people would be comfortable with showing themselves, so annonymity might be required. However, annonymity will only be enforced when you are posting your vulnerabilities.\nOn the other hand, comments will have to be tied to a real face. So there would be real repercussions. Without repercussions, trolls will destroy those who are vulnerable. The verification will require people to submit their LinkedIn Account. Given the professional nature of LinkedIn, it is unlikely that people would be trolling. Of course, the best way is to enforce facial recognition and identification verification like that which is done on major crypto exchanges.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/an_idea/","summary":"A social media where people post the negative things that they are feeling, encountering.

Only then, do we have a better idea of what the article is about. If I write an article with the title in the beginning, it is usually a placeholder just to get my brain working. More often than not, I would end up writing about other concepts that may or may not derive from the initial idea.\nSo why, do I approach life in a different manner? Why am I fixated to choosing a niche or a specialization? Why am I so determined to stay in this path? Because of the sunk cost? Because it is a good opportunity? Because I am in a place where other people want but couldn\u0026rsquo;t get, so I need to cherish it?\nWhat if I approach life in the same way? Instead of choosing to label myself as a Software QA Engineer. Instead of labelling my niche as ABC. Instead of trying to brand myself as XYZ. I should just go with my curiosity and interests.\n Why do we need to specialize? Because it is profitable. At least, I think that\u0026rsquo;s why I choose to specialize, to increase my hireability.\nWhy did I choose to become a QA?\nBecause I foresee QA as being in higher demand in a few years.\nWhen the market starts to get flooded with new Software Engineers, a strong QA would allow the company to bring in \u0026ldquo;weaker\u0026rdquo; Software Engineers.\nBy the industry standard that I am aware of, a single QA should be able to handle testing for 3-5 developers. In 3-5 years, I would be a QA Engineer with hands-on experience with testing large scale, distributed software that uses microservices architecture and have a crazy huge number of QPS.\nIn other words, I am positioning myself to be the a QA that is appealing to start ups, that are transiting into scaling phase. The type of start ups that have just raised series B or C funding.\nAnother upside of being a QA, is that I will be positioned in a way that would allow my future start up to move quickly. If your code keeps breaking due to introduction of new features, the development progress will always be hindered.\n ","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/untitled_wip/","summary":"We are all work in progress.\nWhen I write an article, I would title it in the end, after getting all my ideas out.

# Setup
The purpose is to set up the story. The wrap up of this part, is when the protaganist needs to make a decision. 

## Beginning
The background, context.


## Inciting Incident
A single trigger that cause the start of the journey.
A strong pain. A strong trigger. An event.

Basically, something happens and the underlying context is affected. The peace is disturbed. Or something like that. 

## Second Thoughts
Reference: https://philipp.truebiger.com/three-act-structure/#:~:text=Second%20Thoughts%3A,to%20the%20farm%20and%20work.

The protaganist needs to make a decision. To maintain status quo. Or to fight back. The inciting incident has already thrown things out of whack. Do you live with the new status quo, or do you use this spark to build your own status quo?

# Confrontation
The protaganist chooses to move ahead into the new path. Towards accomplishing the determined goal.

## Obstacles
Challenges that the protaganist encounters as they move on the new path. Each obstacle provides an opportunity for character development. By overcoming those obstacles, the protaganist grows stronger. These also serve as good places for lessons to be incorporated into the story. For the audiences personal takeaway. 


## Disaster & Crisis
Plot twist. After going through challenges and obstacles, and seemingly reaches some stability. The last boss appears and you need to overcome it. 

The way the protaganist handled the past obstacles might be subpar, leading to this disaster occuring. 


# Resolution
Overcoming the final crisis. And finally achieving the goal the protagnist set out to achieve. 

## Overcome
Sense of closure. Tie up the story nicely. Don't leave the audience hanging. Unless there is another chapter. And the whole cycle repeats.

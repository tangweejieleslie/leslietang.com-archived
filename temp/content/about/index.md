## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I am Leslie! I am a Jack-of-Many Trades. 

In the past decade, I had took on multiple roles, be it Data Analysis, Implementing Data Pipelines and Infrastructure, Frontend Development, HCI Research, Backend Development, even Sales and Marketing! I also experienced working in SME of various sizes, start-ups, Public Sector and MNCs. 

Recently, I am learning Blender for 3D Modelling while working on my passion project - **suzabi**.  

**suzabi** is an open world monster taming game with strong emphasis on theorycrafting, featuring real-time player-vs-player. I want to make it into a game that is fun to play and exciting to watch!  

My personal heuristics is to work on and learn what interest you the most. In the event of ties, choose the one that seems to have the most opportunities or a longer runway.

## The Specialist Timeline

If I were to structure my life experience into something that's closer to a specialist, it would look like this. A Multi-Disciplinary System Quality Assurance Engineer who is attuned to both Business and Engineering Stakeholders.

- **System QA Engineer** at Shopee (2020-present)
- Bachelors of Computing in **Computer Science** (Software Engineering, Software Testing, HCI) from NUS (2017-2020)
- **Senior GIS Research Analyst** @ MINDEF (2014-2016)
- **Business** Diploma with Psychology Minor from Temasek Polytechnic (2009-2012)

## The Generalist Timeline

My envisioned end game is to build something that I am proud of that can sustain my livelihood and the livelihood of my family. I think nothing is more precious than the **freedom to build stuffs** that **you want to build**. Of course, for me to get away with that, I would need to build something that people needs and want. 

Here is a timeline of what I've done to make progress towards that vision.

- Part-Time **Software Engineer** + **Product Management** at Fresh Cars Pte Ltd (2020)
- Launched a Prototype that **help gamers** organize and optimize their data and _failed_ to find product market fit (2019)
- **Frontend Engineer** at Katalyst, a **Crypto** Start-Up (2018)
- Launched a Prototype that **help marketers** create graphic content and _failed_ to find product market fit (2017)
- Freelance **Photography + Videography** (2017)
- Launched a Prototype that **analyzes your vocal range** (2017)


### The Constants

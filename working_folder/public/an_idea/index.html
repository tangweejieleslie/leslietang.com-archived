<meta name=description content="A social media where people post the negative things that they are feeling, encountering. The pain, the failures, the obstacles.
A place where people compete on whose life is worse off. And get comforted from seeing people who are in worse state than themselves.
A place where people seek solace and comfort from others who are sharing the same pain.
You know, I think true bonds are forged when you encounter comrade in arms, when you go through a common hardship and overcome the obstacle together.">

<p>However, given the current state of social media, everyone thinks everyone else is living the perfect ideal life. And as a result, we probably become much more isolated. We ended up fighting our battles alone, because we think others are already winning.</p>
<p>This social media, will be a place where people are free to be vulnerable. And in being vulnerable, they will find others who are facing the common enemy. Be it depression, negativity, self-doubt, imposter syndrome, or what&rsquo;s not.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m unsure if people would be comfortable with showing themselves, so annonymity might be required.
However, annonymity will only be enforced when you are posting your vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, comments will have to be tied to a real face. So there would be real repercussions. Without repercussions, trolls will destroy those who are vulnerable.

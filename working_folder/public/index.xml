      <description>Lower Risk Lower Stakes Starting small usually means you have lower stakes.
Compare two scenarios.
One person have an idea, immediately hire a team of engineers to build the idea, only to find out that idea doesn&amp;rsquo;t really solve the problem.
Another try out the idea on a smaller scale. Wizards of Oz method. A phony application that is handled by humans on the backend.
Quicker Results, Quicker Feedback Starting small means you have a smaller workload.</description>

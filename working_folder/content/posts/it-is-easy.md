It is easy to pivot into something with clear upsides. 

Imagine switching from an Analyst in the public sector into Tech in the private sector. 

The upside are obvious. 

- Tech is booming
- You are going into a rapidly growing company
- You are going into a place where you will work with and learn from some of the best engineers
- You get a significant salary jump

Best of all, there's not much downsides. 

- You'll need to put in the prep to get into the company
- You'll work longer hours, since it is competitive 
- It's a step out of your comfort zone

A social media where people post the negative things that they are feeling, encountering.
The pain, the failures, the obstacles. 

A place where people compete on whose life is worse off. And get comforted from seeing people who are in worse state than themselves. 

A place where people seek solace and comfort from others who are sharing the same pain.

You know, I think true bonds are forged when you encounter comrade in arms, when you go through a common hardship and overcome the obstacle together. 

In the modern world, the enemies we face, the battles we fight, are mostly abstract. Enemies like procrastination, self-doubt, depression, fear, desire for a better life. Desire to grow.

However, given the current state of social media, everyone thinks everyone else is living the perfect ideal life. And as a result, we probably become much more isolated. We ended up fighting our battles alone, because we think others are already winning. 

This social media, will be a place where people are free to be vulnerable. And in being vulnerable, they will find others who are facing the common enemy. Be it depression, negativity, self-doubt, imposter syndrome, or what's not.

I'm unsure if people would be comfortable with showing themselves, so annonymity might be required. 
However, annonymity will only be enforced when you are posting your vulnerabilities. 

On the other hand, comments will have to be tied to a real face. So there would be real repercussions. Without repercussions, trolls will destroy those who are vulnerable. The verification will require people to submit their LinkedIn Account. Given the professional nature of LinkedIn, it is unlikely that people would be trolling. Of course, the best way is to enforce facial recognition and identification verification like that which is done on major crypto exchanges.

How would the user flow be?

1. User submit a post about their vulnerabilities. Their pains, the fears, their goals, their desires, their insecurities. 
2. User will be able to choose to be annonymous. 
3. In the beginning the feed will be filled with random strangers. Walls of post of pains that other people are feeling. 
4. You can comment on the post to offer encouragements. If you are facing similar pains, you can jump in and work together. 
5. Commentors will have to be verified. This is to eliminate trolls. 
   1. In such a vulnerable setting, we do not want trolls that end up causing someone to take their own life. 
   2. YES! Words have such an impact!
6. When the user is comfortable, they can choose to reveal themselves. Or not. Whichever make sense. They can also choose to reveal themselves to specific person/s. 
   1. Why? Because the goal is to bond together over common pain and face the challenge together.

It is unlikely for there to be any business profits from the application itself. But it doesn't means that there is no way to fund the project. 

For one, I can look for corporations who are doing social good and seek their backing. Given that Company Social Responsibility is a thing.

I used to think Social Enterprise Start Ups are stupid. But now my personal pain birth an idea, I'm starting to think otherwise. Social Enterprise have a bigger problem to solve. 

Normal Start Up simply need to get a monetization plan going. And that can be done through solving problems that people are willing to pay for. Social Good is different. The money have to come from elsewhere. And it doesn't feel ethical to make money out of those who are seeking help on the platform. Imagine seeing an advertisement about gambling when you are posting about an issue you have with gambling addiction. 

The question is, how can this application be profitable? 

I think one ethical and obvious way is to link users to healthcare professionals. And get a cut from the referral. 

Depending on the type of problems and/or vulnerability, there could be different spectrum of monetization. 
For example, it is obviously unethical to monetize a depressed person.

But what if, a person is simply dejected because they are facing obstacles in their side hustles? And in finding support from fellow side hustlers, they might end up making their passion project a success? I think it is fine to monetize this group of people. 

This is murky, but ultimately, even a social enterprise is an enterprise. If you go out of business, you can't help anyone. 

I think, there is a unique benefit to being a social enterprise. That is, chances are no one will want to compete, simply because profit is not the point. Since there is unlikely to be profits, naturally, people would not want to devote resources to the idea.

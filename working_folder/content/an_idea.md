A social media where people post the negative things that they are feeling, encountering.
The pain, the failures, the obstacles. 

A place where people compete on whose life is worse off. And get comforted from seeing people who are in worse state than themselves. 

A place where people seek solace and comfort from others who are sharing the same pain.

You know, I think true bonds are forged when you encounter comrade in arms, when you go through a common hardship and overcome the obstacle together. 

In the modern world, the enemies we face, the battles we fight, are mostly abstract. Enemies like procrastination, self-doubt, depression, fear, desire for a better life. Desire to grow.

However, given the current state of social media, everyone thinks everyone else is living the perfect ideal life. And as a result, we probably become much more isolated. We ended up fighting our battles alone, because we think others are already winning. 

This social media, will be a place where people are free to be vulnerable. And in being vulnerable, they will find others who are facing the common enemy. Be it depression, negativity, self-doubt, imposter syndrome, or what's not.

I'm unsure if people would be comfortable with showing themselves, so annonymity might be required. 
However, annonymity will only be enforced when you are posting your vulnerabilities. 

On the other hand, comments will have to be tied to a real face. So there would be real repercussions. Without repercussions, trolls will destroy those who are vulnerable. The verification will require people to submit their LinkedIn Account. Given the professional nature of LinkedIn, it is unlikely that people would be trolling. Of course, the best way is to enforce facial recognition and identification verification like that which is done on major crypto exchanges.

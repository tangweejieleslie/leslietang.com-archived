And when you see YouTubers breakdown their income, it typically contains the following components:\n  YouTube Adsense\n  Affiliate Sales\n  Sponsorship\n  Merchandise\n  Authenticity The most authentic content creators, or those that deserves our continued trust, are those that choose to reject monetization that goes against their “policy” or their “values”.\nIn other words, something that does not align with the initial “permission”.\n Authentic Content Creators, are those that stick to their ongoing value proposition. Usually, the same value proposition that compels us to subscribe to them in the first place.\n As content consumers, the permission that we give to marketers, are in the form of subscription, opt-ins, registration, follows, etc.\nAnd usually, the reason we do so is one of the following:\n  We think the Content Creator would deliver more information\n  We think the Content Creator would continue to entertain us\n  We are simply signing up for a sweepstake, lottery, giveaway\n  Niche If permission marketing is about consistently delivery on a promise of value, then niche, is the scope of the value which we will be delivering on.\nRather than thinking of niche as a topic, I think it would be more apt to think of niche as a problem. Because inherently, problems are worth more than information.\nEspecially if the problem is chronic.\nWhat would be my niche?\nMy goal is to achieve financial freedom, as defined through my ideal lifestyle in a prior post. And my content is the documentation of my knowledge gained in this journey. The experimentation. The learnings. The failures. The successes.\nIf I were to scope this into a value proposition, how would it sound like?\n Subscribe, if you want to follow me on my financial journey. Starting as a fresh graduate in 50k debt towards financial freedom, defined as a life where I have full control over my time, and the ability to enjoy my hobbies and dreams.\n What would be the expectations the consumers have in mind?\n  I want to see where this kid goes, I want to see his failures so I can avoid them, I want to see his successes, so I can copy them\n  I want to see the knowledge summary that he makes, so I can save time from reading the books\n  I want to see his action plan, so I can copy and adapt to my own needs\n  I want to know what he did correctly, so I am reassured that the choice is “safe” and would lead to success\n  I want to see his rags to riches story, so I can get inspired, cause I am on the same journey\n  What are the possible underlying problems in the above expectations?\n  Fear of Uncertainty\n  Desire for Stability\n  Lack of information about the journey ahead\n  The first thing that comes into mind, is the fear of uncertainty. It is a scary journey. We could hedge it, if it is a side hustle.\nImagine being a fresh graduate, having this idea, this dream, but also being shackled by a huge student loan debt.\nIt would take someone crazy to pursue all these dreams and ideals rather than simply taking a stable job. Which is pretty much what I’ve chose to do.\nMonetization This is something that I thought about, and something that I was afraid of in the past. And also the same reason why I decided to take on a job as an analyst instead of marketer when I graduate from Business School.\nUltimately, it feels like I am self-serving, for delivering value just for the sake of getting value.\nBut isn’t that how the world works? I am working on my job so that I can get paid. Likewise, I will be creating content, so that I can get paid.\nMaking money through AdSense might make it seem less direct, but it is still payment.\nI think, what I need to do to overcome this limiting belief, would be the following.\n  Commit to over deliver. I need to make sure that those who choose to follow me, will get more out of the relationship than I did.\n  Take responsibility for my content. When I put content out there, it have the potential of creating influence way beyond my wildest imagination. While it is impossible to anticipate all scenarios, I need to make sure I am putting content out in good faith. And I would need to take responsibility for the negative repercussions that comes from it, even if it is beyond my intentions.\n   I think, I just need to trust that belief, that if I can create value, I can make a living for myself doing this\n Conclusion Actionable Steps\n  Decide on the problem that you are solving. This is both your niche and value proposition.\n  Commit on delivery of the value. Consistently. This is the foundation for the ongoing relationship between creator and consumer.\n  Monetize through a win-win situation.\n  ","wordCount":"867","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-09-07T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-09-07T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Leslie Tang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://leslietang.com/posts/permission-marketing/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Leslie TANG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://leslietang.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://leslietang.com accesskey=h title="Leslie TANG (Alt + H)">Leslie TANG</a>

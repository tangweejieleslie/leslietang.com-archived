      <description>All of these are my personal opinions.  If you make investment decisions based on other people&amp;rsquo;s opinions rather than your own formulated judgement, then it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of time before the worst case scenario comes!
 Read the news for facts, not opinions Watch YouTube videos for facts, not opinions, not analysis.
Have a clear exit strategy  If you believe the company you invested in is the market leader  is there a new competitor coming?</description>

      <description>I recorded 2 video with voiceover recently. I realize I hate my voice.
I experimented, I realized I like my voice better when I speak faster.
And then I tried speeding up my voice. After the pitch change as an effect of speeding up at 1.3-1.5x, it actually sounded way better. Although it sounded way higher pitched than my normal vocal range.
Still, it&amp;rsquo;s a fun experiment.
What are the components of the voice we produce?</description>

After watching my video with fresh eyes. I can say with conviction that this is trash.
I would click away without thoughts.
What do I need to improve?
A clearer message. A more compelling reason for viewers to watch. The hook.
What is the value proposition of this video? There are 3 main points in the video.
 Reframing a difficult task  Alternative Phrasing  Expect nothing Don&amp;rsquo;t expect anything Don&amp;rsquo;t expect results immediately Reframe into long term perspective Be realistic but hold the unrealistic dream close to your heart     Simplify the process Reflect and iterate  Credibility These 3 steps, when they come together, should enable someone to start difficult things.</description>

      <description>Learn from the top 5% that started from nothing, and reach there in record time. And model them.
Example. The story of Shinji Takeuchi vs Michael Pelps
Material Beats Methods. For learning language, focus on the high frequency words.
Principle of Transfer. Find a place where learning are interesting. The act becomes fun. Practice the foundation there. The foundational skills will then be transferrable into other areas.

      <description>This time round, I tried creating a simple storyline.
The concept is the &amp;ldquo;Morning before Work&amp;rdquo;.
From the sunrise, to the preparation of the cafe.
To the grabbing of breakfast.
Though the time frame is the same, yet there exist 3 groups of people living very different lives.
The first group have some time to dine in the cafe. The second group have the luxury of working from home. The last group is on the way to office.</description>

Today, I learned about Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins.
This here, is a plugin that helps you zoom in and out for clips. Without using key frames.
But what&amp;rsquo;s more interesting to me, is that there&amp;rsquo;s plugins in Adobe.
I think I found an opportunity. Building Adobe Premiere Pro Plugin.

 plan first do and make spontaneous changes according to new information  Planning for Costly Work I used to think planning first would be better, cause you would make less mistakes. I now think that depends on your proficiency with the subject matter.
It also depends on the stakes. If the plan would affect lives of others, then it make sense to have a plan, and have others verify the soundness of the plan.</description>

      <description>This time round, I&amp;rsquo;ve started with the music. And indeed, the process flows much better. And it&amp;rsquo;s more interesting to find clips that mesh an overarching narrative, that also fits the mood.
Took 2 hours for this. Total Experience: 6 hours.
Let the music guide the visuals I think this is the main takeaway from the past 4 days.
Another new thing that I&amp;rsquo;ve tried is the reversal of clips and adjusting the pace of clips.</description>

      <description>This video will be a summary of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from video edit. For the past 3 days. In the past 3 videos. 4 hours of lessons. Not that much. But 4 hours ahead of anyone who haven&amp;rsquo;t started.
1. Start from the music. It is a lot easier to make the clips fit the music. Compare to making the music fit the clips. If the music is a moody music, you can use LUTs to immediately apply a &amp;ldquo;moody&amp;rdquo; tone to all the clips.</description>

It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean their opinions and claims are invalid. Or rather, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper thinking and communication system to help me go through the points being made.
I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if I&amp;rsquo;m interpreting their points wrongly, through my personal filter about the subject matter

In most statements, there would be the claim. And there would be the argument.
You&amp;rsquo;ll commit the fallacy fallacy, when you asert that someone&amp;rsquo;s claim is false, because their argument is poor.
We have to recognize, that someone can make a correct claim with poor or incorrect argument, or with other logical fallacies.
Someone can also make a wrong claim with a strong and seemingly correct argument, without any fallacies.</description>

      <description>Level 1 Reading, to me is the extraction of information. I will not process them yet. Basically this is the ground work to help me absorb the information.

      <description>Pancake Technique. It is a workflow that&amp;rsquo;s useful for large projects with multiple versions and edits.
 Create a &amp;ldquo;Selection Sequence&amp;rdquo;. Basically this sequence contains all the clips, with the respective in and out points set and ready for usage Create a &amp;ldquo;Final Edit Sequence&amp;rdquo;. Show both sequences, one over another, in the timeline panel Drag clips from Selection Sequence down to the Final Edit Sequence  Label used clips with a different color to prevent confusion   If there&amp;rsquo;s revision needed, CREATE A NEW SEQUENCE!</description>

What make games addictive are the denial of rewards. How can we bring this to habits building and life in general?
Battle Royales are addictive due to the denial of rewards. Where you don&amp;rsquo;t always win. Nothing to do with fun.
Addiction Aspect
 playing although not having fun is due to addiction due to dopamine reinforcement circuitory behavior reinforcement  This immediately refutes Atomic Habit&amp;rsquo;s 4 steps framework.</description>

      <title>Second Attempt at Video Edit</title>

      <description>Second video sequence attempt: https://youtu.be/fcXv1gw3SHU
This time round it took about an hour.
Had remembered the mistake about sequence settings. This time round it&amp;rsquo;s a HD version. But had forgotten to set Codec, which slows down the rendering during edit.
Remember to Set Sequence Rendering Codec Experimented with Transitions. Movement and blur effects. It didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly went as I expected, nonetheless, it&amp;rsquo;s still an attempt. Would need to research more about transitions and adjustment layers.</description>

      <description>My first video sequence attempt, using Adobe Premiere Pro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrUc7GaoAA
Some of the challenges encountered.
1. Finding the appropriate clips The difficulty is finding the right clips that will express the ideas I have in mind.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a mistake on the sequence settings. Somewhere along the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve set the sequence to be 1280x720 instead of 1920x1080. It&amp;rsquo;s too much of a hassle to redo everyone on 1080p so I ended up uploading a 720p video.</description>

      <description>Joy of discovery.
I want to incorporate that element into my game. Something like Kaizoku Oujo, episode 5.
I want to somehow incorporate emotions, or triggers of emotions, within my game.</description>

      <description>Progression on Web Landscapes should not be seen as Linear.
While new advancements are built on old advancements, the potential for progression is never linear.
It only seems linear after abstraction. After drastic simplification.
In fact, many things are often not linear. But are presented linearly.
Let me define linear in a diagram A -&amp;gt; B -&amp;gt; C
In reality, things would probably look more like A -&amp;gt; B A -&amp;gt; B1 B1 -&amp;gt; C B1 -&amp;gt; C2</description>

      <description>The thing that I often hear about Atomic Habits, is the system that gives you 37x growth in a year.
When I hear about 1% improvements, compounded across the year, I thought it sounded difficult to improve in the samething 1% daily. And I thought 37x growth in one year sounds even more daunting.
The first thing that comes into mind is that this claim is as absurd as those that claim to make X% returns on Y amount, through Forex daily.</description>

      <description>Recently I keep seeing about Web 3.0.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m researching it.
https://internationalbanker.com/technology/what-is-web-3-0-and-why-does-it-matter/
https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/3003/web-30-and-40
https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/cryptos-networked-collaboration-will-drive-web-3-0/
Ok, the more I read, the more confusing it gets.
The definition of Web 3.0 changes depending on when the article is written.
The recent trends that I heard about Web 3.0 are mainly due to blockchain technologies.
Things get confusing when concepts from humanities and social sciences gets in.</description>

      <description>I was reading &amp;ldquo;Writing Tools&amp;rdquo; by Roy Peter Clark, to gain some insights that will help me write better. Tool 24 about working from a plan stood out to me.
Minimum Viable Writing In the book, Roy cited an interesting example. About readings being able to get the story and the gist of the writing, the essential parts of the writing, from the headings and subheadings alone.
In other words, from headings and subheadings, we can quickly determine if the idea presented would be valuable, or not.</description>

      <title>Premiere Pro Basic Workflow</title>

      <description>I wrote down the steps from the class by Jordy Vandeput on Skillshare. For me, video edit is a pain, mainly because of the sheer number of actions in the UI.
After going through the first video, I realized there is a logical design decision behind Adobe Premiere Pro. That logical flow becomes obvious, once you understand the general workflow.
General Workflow All video edits start with the bin. The bin contains all the relevant resources.</description>

So that you will grow into a person, with a new identity. An identity that will bring you the results you desire.\nNow then, this is the fun part, coming up with a strategy and action plan.\nBefore I’ve set up my website, I was writing on substack. In that article, I’ve set some financial goals.\nIdeal Lifestyle Financial goals based around the lifestyle that I desire. My ideal lifestyle consist of the following\n 3 days of tennis each week, on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday A house worth SGD $1.5m, based on the research I’ve done then 10 days of Travel each year, to Japan  To achieve that lifestyle, I would need to first accumulate about $375,000 + $5,000 = $380,000 for the upfront payment. And I would need to be able to pay $68,295 + $10,000 + $7,786 = $86,081/year.\nAssume that I only inflat my lifestyle for the above 3 points, my basic living expenses would remain at $600/month = $7,200 / year. This brings me to a total of $93,281 / year. Or $7,774/month.\nMy current annual compensation is approximately $70,200 - $83,700. (range given to hide my salary, also to account for the variable components in my compensation package)\n    Upfront Annual Outflow Monthly Outflow     Top-end luxury with all my current desires fulfilled $430k $94k $7.8k   In-between ($600k house) $200k $44k $3.6k   Minimalistic Lifestyle $50k (debt) $7.2k $600    Figures are rounded up\nDifferent Paths The main paths are concern with cash inflow that occurs as a result of the value that I created.\nPath 1. Just remain on my path If I were to simply stay on my current path, I could achieve my “In-between” lifestyle in about 5 years without much effort. Although that would force me to remain on the same path for another 15-20 years.\nMy current path is\n A single stream of income Continue my minimalistic lifestyle Continue trading my time for money  Path 1b. Job Hopping. This is pretty much a proven strategy, but fundamentally, nothing changes. At this point, I still like my job at Shopee.\nPath 1c. Job Downgrade This might happen given some conditions.\n WFH stop being the norm. This means that I’ll lose about 15 hours per week to commute time. If I am unable to convert the commute time into productive time, then I would consider a job downgrade.  Path 2. Attempt to build alternative income sources The idea is to use my free time to explore alternative income. Some things that stands out for now includes\n Game Development Content Creation  Newsletter Blog Articles Podcast Videos   Creating Applications (bootstrap startup)  Notice, I’m not considering things like freelance, tutorial, one-on-one teaching, consulting. Because these are still trading time for money. Right now, I’m attempting to build stuffs that will give me leverage over time.\nSide Path. Investments The side path is cash inflow, as a result of the money that I’ve invested.\nMy current monthly allocation formula is as follow\n Essential Expense = $600 Monthly Balance = Cash Inflow - Essential Expenses Monthly Investment Allocation Amount = Monthly Balance Allocation = 40x + 40y + 20z x: Individual Tech Related Stocks (TSLA, NVDA, PLTR) y: Crypto z: S\u0026P500 z: also serve as \"savings\" for emergency This is the side path that I’m already traveling on, and will continue to travel on. Regardless of which path I choose in the future.\nThe point of the main path, is to increase Cash Inflow, so that my portfolio will grow faster.\nStrategy A quick breakdown of my desired outcome.\n Best Case Scenario, $100k/year. Made indirectly, i.e. not trading my time directly for money.  this could be through code, content, employees, etc   End Goal is to have full control over my time  What are some tactics / actions that I can use to achieve the above outcome?\n Writing as a Form of Thinking (Written Content) Writing Notes (Written Content) Notes - Podcast (Audio Content) Podcast as Voiceover + B-Rolls - Videos (Video Content) Writing Visual Notes (Image Content) Writing Code (Code Content) - Guide (Written Content) - Podcast (Audio Content)  Guide + Diagrams (Image Content) Podcast + Diagrams + B-Rolls - Videos (Video Content)    What are the fundamental actions?\n Read Write Synthesize Voiceover Video Creation Coding (just by continue working, I would keep using this skill without thought) Image Design Diagrams and Illustrations Teaching (guide-based content) - this sounds like the first skill I should work on developing. I feel like this is a low hanging fruit. Furthermore, this can mesh well with the learning that I will be embarking on. Story Telling Idea Generation Market Validation Marketing Selling Communication  The above would be the core pillars that will make me into a person that can bring in $100k/year.\nRight now, coding is the sole skill that can bring in majority of the income. If I double down on that, it would require me to create stuffs that people would need. i.e. solving problems.\n","wordCount":"834","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Leslie Tang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://leslietang.com/posts/a-loose-strategy/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Leslie TANG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://leslietang.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://leslietang.com accesskey=h title="Leslie TANG (Alt + H)">Leslie TANG</a>

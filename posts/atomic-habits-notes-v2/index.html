For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.”\n The thesis is to build small habits and get them to compound, making you a better person.\nPersonal Thoughts: I agree with this argument, improving every day is better than deteoriating every day. The compounding chart is there to serve as a visual. A Hook.\nI don’t think it is meant to be a definite fact.\nAlthough my friends are going crazy over this. The same way they go crazy over the potential of making 1% return daily on the Forex courses they are hearing about. Pretty sure it might be a logical fallacy. Need to read up about it.\nPlateau Most progression are non-linear, although people expects them to be. This leads to a period where the progress falls below expectations. James Clear coin that difference - “Valley of Disappointment”.\nSeth Godin call this “The Dip”. Basically, in all endeavors worth pursuing, there will be a period of drought where there will be no results, in fact, you might even be bleeding during those period.\nIn both cases, getting through the Dip or the Valley of Disappointment is crucial. Cause that is where the rewards lies.\nWhat I took from Seth Godin’s “The Dip”, is that you’ll need resources, and you’ll have opportunity costs for choosing to go through the Dip. And if you are unable to go through the Dip, you’ll end up wasting a whole lot of resources.\nJames Clear take is that all valley of disappointments can be overcomed, through a system of habit.\nProblems with Goals Winners and Losers have the Same Goals hmm, do they not have the same system too? or similar systems.\nAchieving Goal is ONLY Momentary It’s like reaching a milestone. Now what?\nGoals Restrict Happiness On the assumption that “once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy”\nGoals are at Odds with Long-term Progress Goals can create a yo-yo effect. Work hard. Achieve Goal. Now what? Revert to Old Habits.\nAlthough, I don’t think this means don’t set goals. Goals are still necessary for setting some form of direction. To elicit some level of clarity. It’s just that goals alone will not be enough. The first step is to set your goals. The next step, is to consider what systems can be put in place to help you achieve those goals.\nThe thesis of this book, seems to be centered around habits. Build the correct habits that will come together and make you into a person that can make the goal a reality.\nSystem of Atomic Habits A system, of small, tiny changes, marginal gains, 1 percent improvements, that adds up into dramatic change.\nChapter 2 Habits and Identity and Habits. It’s a cycle. Habits shapes identity. Identity shapes habit.\n3 Layers of Behavior Change Outcomes The results. Things like losing weight, publish a book, winning. Most goals are results-oriented. Especially if you set goals using the SMART framework. Just being “Specific” and “Measurable” requires you to set something that is result oriented.\nProcess Habits and System. The focus of the book. Basically, about your actions and environment.\nIdentity Worldview. Beliefs. Self-image. Assumptions. This reminds me of Anthony Robbins. I remembered reading something about human desire to be congruent with their personal identity. A quick search bring up this video clip. I think it’s probably in the book Personal Power or Awaken the Giant Within.\nChanging Your Identity  Decide the type of person you want to be Prove it with small wins  The part about proving with small wins, is to create evidence that will reinforce your beliefs about yourself. Recall when you take MBTI, you are basically asked multiple questions about how you would approach or what you have recently done in various hypothetical scenario.\nHow do you answer those questions? By seeking references to evidences in your mind. And you rationalize it by the frequency of those evidences.\nWhy Habits Matter They give you evidences that will support your new identity.\nChapter 3 4 Steps to Building Better Habits\nAbout Habit Loops 1. Cue In NLP, they call this the anchor. In operant conditioning, they call this the stimulus. For our brain to learn the cue, they would need to be exposed to the entire chain. Cue, Action, Reward. Repeated enough time, it will become automatic.\nI think studies has shown that this loop could be broken down over time by deteoriation. Need to find the reference material for confirmation…\n2. Craving James Clear define this as the motivation force. It’s basically the anticipation of the rewards. I think that’s where Dopamine kicks in. You don’t really control this. This is neuroscience territory. Video from Dr K About Dopamine Dopamine are what our brain uses to reinforce the behavior that is rewarding.\n3. Response Basically the action, in response to the cue. This only happens if the cue is anchored to some form of anticipation of reward. The exact action you take, is in hope of attaining the reward.\n4. Reward Basically the outcomes of the action.\n “Rewards are the end goal of every habit”\n In short, the entire loop from cue to reward, which then reinforces the craving, will lead to sticky habits.\n4 Laws of Behavior Change     Cue Craving Response Reward     Creating Good Habit Make cue obvious Make it attractive Make action easy Make reward satisfying   Breaking Bad Habits Make cue invisible Make it unattractive Make it difficult to take action Make it unsatisfying    My Thoughts From my superficial understanding of Neuroscience, I think it might be impossible to control “Cravings” directly. I would think Cravings would be a dependent variable. Rewards would be potential independent variables. Although in such cases, what we really want to achieve is to change the response. Or to control the response.\nWhen we think about habits, we probably have this idealized vision of being able to “run effortlessly every day”. The part about running effortlessly every day is the response, the desired action.\nI would also argue that habits could be form without massive repetitions, although those might have various confounders which makes it not so replicable.\nI’ll just leave a counter example. An anecdote, but still a counter example.\nI have a friend who has never smoked in his life. He tried it once, and immediately got hooked. He ended up becoming a chain smoker. If habits requires multiple repetitions, how did he build such a sticky habit in a single repetition?\nExamples and Action Plans The rest of the chapters (4 to 17) focus on research and stories, with examples of action plans. I’ll just take notes on those that stood out.\n Habits Scorecard  inspired by the “Pointing-and-Calling” system, designed to reduce mistakes I have experience working in critical environments, where a single mistake can cause tremendous loss. In those environments, we always have a set of checklist.  Checklist prevents people from making mistakes. It forces us to focus on each detail.   James Clear suggested the usage of habits scorecard to raise our awareness. This is indeed a very useful way to do so. Habits Scorecard, Checklists, such tools are useful to build mindfulness   Implementation Intention Formula  I will [DO SOMETHING] at [SPECIFIC TIME] in [SPECIFIC LOCATION]   Habit Stacking  after habit 1, I will do habit 2   Environment over Motivation  you can design your environment to make it trigger desirable actions/habits   Remove cues to undesirable habits  Conclusion Build a ton of small habits, they will stack up and make you a new person.\n","wordCount":"1327","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-19T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Leslie Tang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://leslietang.com/posts/atomic-habits-notes-v2/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Leslie TANG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://leslietang.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://leslietang.com accesskey=h title="Leslie TANG (Alt + H)">Leslie TANG</a>

I would think Cravings would be a dependent variable. Rewards would be potential independent variables. Although in such cases, what we really want to achieve is to change the response. Or to control the response.</p><p>When we think about habits, we probably have this idealized vision of being able to &ldquo;run effortlessly every day&rdquo;. The part about running effortlessly every day is the response, the desired action.</p><p>I would also argue that habits could be form without massive repetitions, although those might have various confounders which makes it not so replicable.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll just leave a counter example. An anecdote, but still a counter example.</p><p>I have a friend who has never smoked in his life. He tried it once, and immediately got hooked. He ended up becoming a chain smoker. If habits requires multiple repetitions, how did he build such a sticky habit in a single repetition?</p><h1 id=examples-and-action-plans>Examples and Action Plans<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#examples-and-action-plans>#</a></h1><p>The rest of the chapters (4 to 17) focus on research and stories, with examples of action plans.

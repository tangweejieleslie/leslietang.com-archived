For the past 3 days. In the past 3 videos. 4 hours of lessons. Not that much. But 4 hours ahead of anyone who haven’t started.\n1. Start from the music. It is a lot easier to make the clips fit the music. Compare to making the music fit the clips. If the music is a moody music, you can use LUTs to immediately apply a “moody” tone to all the clips. e.g. blue wash the video. You can also add additional sound effects to strengthen the mood.\nMost importantly, musics have their own set of rhythm and melody. It is easier to cut the clips to fit the rhythm of the music.\nEdit transitions to the beat might seems cool. But overdoing it will make the video predictable. In other words, boring. Maybe change up the beat. Maybe sync the hero clip to climax at the beat. Experiment. Have fun!\n2. Transition between the clips. If the clips are not shot with transition in mind, any post production transition will feel off. There’s only so much you can salvage.\nPersonally, I’ve been using stock footage. The difficulty is finding good shots that matches what I have in mind. This leads to very robotic, or generic transitions.\n3. Settings are important Video Settings I’m using Adobe Premiere Pro. In each seqeuence, there’s a lot of settings. I barely know what they mean. For now, I’m using DNxHD 29.97. Basically, 1080p aspect ratio, 29.97 frame rate.\nI didn’t take note of the settings for my first video, and the end results ended up being 720px.\nAbout Frames I tried playing around with slowing down of the clips. The clips ended up looking choppy. This is because of “missing frames”. You can apply Optical Flow, which fills in the missing frame. Cool feature. This makes the slowed down clip looks smoother.\n4. Shortcut Keys Learn them. Extremely useful. Speed up the process. You’ll learn them as you work and try things out. When you notice yourself clicking on something over and over again, hover over it and find the name of that button. If there’s a short cut key assigned to it, it will show up as well. If not, you can go into the shortcut keys settings and assign that action to a shortcut.\n5. Be Organized Make use of bins (basically folders). You can open folders in multiple tabs.\nKeep sequences separate. When making changes to your sequences, duplicate them. Serves as good back up. You’ll always want a point of reference to compare changes. How else would you know the changes are better?\nYou can stack multiple sequences on the timeline panel. This allows you to get parts from one sequence and move it into another. Useful when you are making changes to previous versions.\nUse Adjustment Layers. You don’t want to manually make effect changes to each clip.\n6. Try again with fresh perspective I’ve structured my 4 hours across 3 days. I’ll reflect on my previous work and try to make some improvements on the new video. There is no way a short article or a video will teach you everything.\nYou’ll have to add in your own takes, your own ideas.\nMy first video was made following a tutorial. My second and third were made based on my own ideas after reflecting on the first video.\n For me, the most impactful lesson is the one about starting with the music. I’ve learnt this lesson after getting frustrated with finding music that fits the clip. So I’ve decided to flip the workflow and it worked better.\nIf I were to make it into a video, the B-Rolls should illustrate the workflow. And I should turn those B-Rolls into GIF for my article.\nIf I want to make it into a story driven video. hmm, sounds overly dramatic. But might be interesting. Let’s just try it.\n ","wordCount":"662","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-10-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Leslie Tang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://leslietang.com/posts/video-about-learning-video-editting/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Leslie TANG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://leslietang.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://leslietang.com accesskey=h title="Leslie TANG (Alt + H)">Leslie TANG</a>

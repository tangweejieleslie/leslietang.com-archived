What makes you different? who trained/influenced you? have you trained others to do this? have they replicated your results? what are the biggest mistakes and myths you see in X training? what are your favourite books/resources on X? if people had to teach themselves, what would you suggest they use? if you were to train me for 4 weeks for a competition and had a million dollars on the line, what would the training look like? what if I had 8 weeks?

It works well in helping me save and invest.\nAnd after reaching the limits of saving and investment. The new question that pops up in my mind, is how can I make more?\n This article, serves as a self-reflection. A “Thinking in Public” type of article.\nWhy the obsession with money? This is what I want to find out, but simply asking this doesn’t really bring much idea into mind.\nWhat am I trying to accomplish with the money?\nI want to buy a house. I want to be able to spend money on hobbies. I want to travel. I want to be wealthy enough that I don’t have to constantly restrain myself.\nWhy can’t I do them now?\nBecause it feels like I am killing the goose for a short-term pleasure. It make long-term sense to accumulate a good investment portfolio before spending the returns from the portfolio.\nSo How Large of a Portfolio am I looking at?\nFirst, I need to consider what sort of life do I want to live.\nTravel If I want to travel to Japan for 10 days a year. The flight would probably cost $2000 (random figure). The accommodation around $2000 as well. 3 meals a day, on good meals that I would enjoy, maybe $2000. Spending money on collectibles, maybe $1000. Spending money on transportation and experiences, maybe $3000?\nThat would be about $10,000 across 10 days. All figures are without any basis or research.\n $10,000 per year\n Tennis If possible, I would want to play tennis 3 days a week, 2 hours each. I would also like to have a tennis machine, since I might not be able to find a partner at all times. I would probably have an upfront cost of $5000 for the machine and the balls.\nAssuming I would play for 24 hours per month. And the cost of court booking is $ 20/hour. That would be $ 480/month, or $5760/year for court bookings.\nI would probably need to restring every month playing at that pace. That would bring restring cost to $ 240/year. Assuming I’m using training balls, replaced quarterly, that would be about $ 400/year. Across the year, there would be about 156 tennis session. Assuming 25% of those sessions are games with a two new cans ($ 12 each) of ball each session, that would be about $ 936/year. With 156 tennis sessions each year, I would probably have to cycle through 3 pairs of tennis shoes. That would be at $450/year.\n $7,786 per year\n$5,000 upfront\n House I would also want to have my own house at some point. The house that I want for long-term accommodation, based on current market rate, would be around $ 1,500,000. Given a 20 years loan. 25% down payment. 2% annual interest rate. The upfront cost is $375,000. The monthly repayment is $5,691.19. The renovations and furnishings would probably cost $ 150,000. (another random number)\nCalculations done with this spreadsheet\n $68,294.28 per year\n$525,000 upfront\n For now, these are the biggest expenses that I can think of, that I would want in my “ideal” life. The house is the lowest priority. In other words, I think I am saying that if I can achieve the first two things on my list, I would be “living” my ideal life.\nTo live ideal lifestyle, I would need to be able to spend $17,786 per year. That would be about 35% of my current income.\nIf I want to sustain this lifestyle from the returns on my portfolio, I would need to wait until 2030, assuming 8% ROI, 85% contribution, 3% pay raise, to live this lifestyle.\nIf I reduce my investments allocation from 85% to 50%, I can actually live this lifestyle right now. In doing so, I would need additional 6 years to sustain this lifestyle with my investments.\nThe impact of doing so is that it would take longer for me to get my house, which is already lower in priority. How much longer?\nAt 85% allocation to investments, I would be able to repay the annual loan value with my investments from 2048. But by then, I wouldn’t qualify for a 20 years loan.\nThat means I wouldn’t be able to live in a 1.5m house. If I reduce the value of the house to $ 600,000. The upfront down payment would be $ 150,000 and the monthly loan repayment would be $ 2,276.48 ($ 27,317.76/year).\nAt 85% allocation, I would be able to pay for the house with my investments in 2035. Maybe just barely reaching the cut off point for 20 years loan.\nConclusion I think I have a rough overview of the situation. If I just live with my parents forever, I don’t have to buy a house, and can sustain my ideal lifestyle immediately. And sustain it indefinitely by 2035.\nIf I want to buy a house, I would need to hold off my desired lifestyle until 2041. By then, I would be able to sustain the house loan repayment and my desired lifestyle indefinitely. Although by then, my desired lifestyle would probably have changed.\nAlso, the calculations are over simplified. So this is more like a rough gauge of things. But the thought of working my life off until 2035 or 2041 before I can enjoy life. This doesn’t sounds like living at all. By then I would be about half dead!\nWhich means my intuition is right, I do need to prioritize wealth and increase my earning power. The question is, by how much?\nAssuming that I start a side hustle and it matches my salary in 2025 (4 year plan), the milestone years will be 2027 (vs 2035) or 2034 (vs 2041). Putting me 7-8 years ahead of schedule. Assuming I keep working on my side hustle and job.\nMy daily schedule for the next 4 years will probably be intense. The more I think about it, the more I feel that I’ve started too late. But it will only get later if I don’t start now.\n","wordCount":"1081","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-08-29T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-08-29T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Leslie Tang"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://leslietang.com/posts/why-do-i-put-wealth-as-one-of-my-priority/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Leslie TANG","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://leslietang.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://leslietang.com accesskey=h title="Leslie TANG (Alt + H)">Leslie TANG</a>

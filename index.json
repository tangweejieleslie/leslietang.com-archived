[{"content":"The beliefs I have about writing.\n Writing should be done with a target audience in mind Writing should be structured Writing should create value  A poorly structured writing without a target audience in mind would be messy. And messy writing does not create value. That\u0026rsquo;s why I should not write.\nThe paradox is that I will never know which writings are valuable until I created them. Value is only assessable in hindsight.\nAs a marketing plan to create media leverage, I would guess that my current writings will never make it.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s fine.\nFor now, I should just write for myself. To organize my thought. To improve my writing skills. To think about hypothetical target audience that would find value in my work, and re-work the drafts to fit the audience later.\nQuoting sywx, my current value proposition is a beginner\u0026rsquo;s mind.\n Because you learn in public. By teaching you, they teach many. You amplify them. You have one thing they don’t: a beginner’s mind. You see how this works?\n And I suspect this might become valuable datapoint in the future. For example, someone who wants to go on this same path as me would have a map perfectly laid out.\n Future Add-ons  Be more explicit with my thoughts - for example, the why, the planning, the iterations, the drafts - each versions are accessible through github, so that part is set  because the why, the aim, the objective of the post, where do I see this post heading, etc, would all be valuable context    ","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/why-did-i-waited-so-long/","summary":"The beliefs I have about writing.\n Writing should be done with a target audience in mind Writing should be structured Writing should create value  A poorly structured writing without a target audience in mind would be messy.

You don’t need anyone’s permission to do them, and that’s why they are very egalitarian. They’re great equalizers of leverage.\n I write in public because I want to build media leverage. I want to build media leverage because I believe it will eventually make me rich. Even if it fails to make me rich, it would have forced me to organize my thoughts and deepen my understanding on the things that I\u0026rsquo;m writing. Writing in public might create more accountability. This might make me more consistent than simply writing in private.\nWhat I want to achieve from writing in public  Media Leverage - articles that creates value, and is consumed by many Monetization - as long as value is created, there would be opportunity for riches to be created Deeper Understanding - I would deepen my knowledge through additional processing for public consumption   Future Add-ons  Metrics to track the above objectives Systems to make it consistent - Atomic Habits, James Clear Rules for \u0026ldquo;Bare Minimum Content\u0026rdquo; so that my habit streak will not break  ","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/why-do-i-write/","summary":"I am already writing in private - notes, scraps, etc. My private writing style only make sense to me, by improving my writing, I would be improving my understanding.\nI chance upon two articles -\n \u0026ldquo;Learning in Public\u0026rdquo; by swyx https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public   At some point people will start asking you for help because of all the stuff you put out. 80% of developers are “dark”, they dont write or speak or participate in public tech discourse.","title":"Why do I Write"}]

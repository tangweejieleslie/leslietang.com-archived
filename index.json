[{"content":"My first video sequence attempt, using Adobe Premiere Pro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrUc7GaoAA\nSome of the challenges encountered.\n1. Finding the appropriate clips The difficulty is finding the right clips that will express the ideas I have in mind.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also made a mistake on the sequence settings. Somewhere along the process, I\u0026rsquo;ve set the sequence to be 1280x720 instead of 1920x1080. It\u0026rsquo;s too much of a hassle to redo everyone on 1080p so I ended up uploading a 720p video.\n2. Finding suitable music I wonder if there\u0026rsquo;s any libraries or tools that will give you the music that you have in mind.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s extremely difficult to describe music, especially for someone like me with no music background.\nEditing the transition to the beat is even more challenging. I gave up on editing to beat.\nInstead, I\u0026rsquo;ve added audio effects at the point of transition. I think once I learn more about the different effects, this might be a useful trick.\n3. Transition between clips I didn\u0026rsquo;t apply any transition this time round. I think I rather have it jump between scenes than having a weird transition. Another thing that I need to pick up.\n It took me about 2 hours just to get this 14 seconds sequence out. Newfound respect to YouTube content creators. Especially those who does their own edits.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/first-video-sequence-attempt/","summary":"My first video sequence attempt, using Adobe Premiere Pro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrUc7GaoAA\nSome of the challenges encountered.\n1.

And I thought 37x growth in one year sounds even more daunting.\nThe first thing that comes into mind is that this claim is as absurd as those that claim to make X% returns on Y amount, through Forex daily. They are essentially implying everyone will become million and billionaires in 1 year, depending on X and Y.\nThe numbers make sense. The logic seems to make sense. But does the whole thing make sense?\nOne thing that stood out is the \u0026ldquo;Law of Marginal Aggregation\u0026rdquo;. I think this is the thing that gets misused. As a magical system that gives everyone 37x gains in a year with small effort.\nTour De France Stats Reference: https://www.letour.fr/en/history\n   Year Stages Distance (km) 1st Place Finish Time Number of GBR in top 10 Notes     2012 20 3497 87H 34' 47'' 2 Team Sky 1st place   2013 21 3404 83H 56' 40'' 1 Team Sky 1st place   2014 21 3659 89H 59' 06'' 0    2015 21 3354 84H 46' 14'' 0    2016 21 3525 89H 04' 48'' 1 Team Sky 1st place   2017 21 3540 86H 20' 55'' 2 Team Sky 1st place   2018 21 3349 83H 17' 13'' 2 Team Sky 1st place   2019 21 3366 82H 57' 00'' 1    2020 21 3483 87H 20' 05'' 1     I look up the stats to convince myself that Team Sky is indeed doing something right. The results shows true. You need to be doing something right to get 1st place 5/9 times. This gives credibility to the Law of Marginal Aggregation.\nHow do we apply Law of Marginal Aggregation? First, identify all possible actions that could potentially be related to the desired outcome.\nA mind map sounds like the most intuitive way to do this.\n![[Pasted image 20211018063629.png]]\nWe can start by thinking about the obvious things. To win a cycling race, what the the obvious components? The cyclist and the bicycle. And then we can think of the different components that makes up each of them, and the potential components that would affect the end result.\nAnd as you branch out into the various components and factors, you\u0026rsquo;ll eventually reach a point where you can no longer fan out further. i.e. you have arrived at all the atomic parts of the system.\nStrategy to Build The Habits  Build a new Identity Build a new Belief System Strengthen them with new Evidences Gain New Evidence by Tracking your Actions  When I think about Identity, the first thing that pops into mind is the Myers Briggs Type Indicator.\n**How does most of these indicator works? **\nYou answer a questionaire about yourself. You answer them based on what you think is the most correct answer.\nHow did you make the choice about those answers?\nBy referring to your memory of specific events and your actions, and thoughts, in those specific events.\nQuestion. Are these our \u0026ldquo;Natural Tendencies\u0026rdquo;, or are these our \u0026ldquo;Comfortable Tendencies\u0026rdquo;? Or maybe, are these our \u0026ldquo;Most Frequent/Common/Memorable Tendencies?\u0026rdquo;\nPersonal Action Plan 1. Goals Setting I will still start from goals. Goals are there as a guiding point, towards some concrete direction. Become healthier for the sake of health doesn\u0026rsquo;t evoke much emotions, neither is it inspiring. Become healthier because I want to live longer and be with my family for as long as humanly possible is much more inspiring.\n2. Factors Brainstorm Of course, we do not stop at goals setting. Next step, would be to think about the different components and factors that will relate to the goal. For example, health naturally is a result of what you eat and what you do with your body. The obvious components (maybe direct) are \u0026ldquo;Nutrition\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Exercise\u0026rdquo;. Not so obvious components (indirect) could be sleep, environment, amount of sunlight.\n3. Identity Identification Then, I should identify existing beliefs about myself and what are the evidences that forms my beliefs about that identity. And whether these identities and beliefs are in conflict with my goals. Whether if there\u0026rsquo;s any obvious alignment between the factors with my existing beliefs.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s alignment, the change should come easy. Else, I would need to work on building new identities.\n4. Gathering Evidences The easiest form of gathering evidence, is to further breakdown the identity into smaller components. Alongside the existing evidences you have. To break your existing identity, you simply need to offer counter evidences.\nIf you belief yourself to be fat, and that is supported by evidence of desire for sweet food. A simple counter example is to throw away the sweet food you have. Or to give them away.\nThrowing them away reinforce the idea that you think sweet food are trash. Giving them away reinforce the idea that you value your friends more than your sweet tooth, maybe.\nEach time you create a new counter evidence, record it. This serve as a tangible evidence that is way stronger than your memory about old evidences.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/atomic-habits-notes/","summary":"The thing that I often hear about Atomic Habits, is the system that gives you 37x growth in a year.\nWhen I hear about 1% improvements, compounded across the year, I thought it sounded difficult to improve in the samething 1% daily.

This is my first memory of interaction with the internet. We visit websites by going straight to the domain names. I remember entering random domain names to see where they will bring me. I remember seeing domain names on television and posters. This is the era where we still lived mainly in the physical world. Search Engines. This is when we are able to discover new websites easily. Blogs. This is the era where we would put links to our friends blogs. Where we would share updates of our lives, mainly through text. There\u0026rsquo;s no smart phones. So it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to have access to pictures. Social Media. This is when we started sharing a portion of ourselves online. And seeing a curated snippets of other people\u0026rsquo;s lives. The social network that I used are those that my friends are using. Started off with Friendster and Hi5, and then ended with Facebook. We would scan our year book onto the computer and use those as our profile pictures. Or we would befriend people who have access to camera and ask them for a custom photo. Web Gaming. Social Media Gaming. Smart Phones. Mobile Gaming. Photo Sharing. Everyone with a smartphone can easily take pictures and share them. Videos Sharing and Streaming. People can also take videos and share them easily. Live Streaming. As network improves, live streaming becomes a reality. Online Purchases (this happens earlier, it\u0026rsquo;s just that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t 18 yet, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a card for transactions) Blockchain. NFT NFT Gaming  Hmm, is my life simply tied to gaming, or is gaming usually one of the first few use cases of new technology?\nSocial Media games make it so that people can compete and flaunt their progress. Things like leaderboards is one of the key experience in those games. At least for myself.\nMobile games make it so that you can play anywhere. About the time when I stopped buying new handheld consoles.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/web-3.0-braindump/","summary":"Recently I keep seeing about Web 3.0.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is, that\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m researching it.\nhttps://internationalbanker.com/technology/what-is-web-3-0-and-why-does-it-matter/\nhttps://www.finextra.com/blogposting/3003/web-30-and-40\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/cryptos-networked-collaboration-will-drive-web-3-0/\nOk, the more I read, the more confusing it gets.\nThe definition of Web 3.0 changes depending on when the article is written.\nThe recent trends that I heard about Web 3.0 are mainly due to blockchain technologies.\nThings get confusing when concepts from humanities and social sciences gets in.","title":"Web 3.0 Braindump"},{"content":"I was reading \u0026ldquo;Writing Tools\u0026rdquo; by Roy Peter Clark, to gain some insights that will help me write better.

In the past 3 videos. 4 hours of lessons. Not that much. But 4 hours ahead of anyone who haven\u0026rsquo;t started.\n1. Start from the music. It is a lot easier to make the clips fit the music. Compare to making the music fit the clips. If the music is a moody music, you can use LUTs to immediately apply a \u0026ldquo;moody\u0026rdquo; tone to all the clips. e.g. blue wash the video. You can also add additional sound effects to strengthen the mood.\nMost importantly, musics have their own set of rhythm and melody. It is easier to cut the clips to fit the rhythm of the music.\nEdit transitions to the beat might seems cool. But overdoing it will make the video predictable. In other words, boring. Maybe change up the beat. Maybe sync the hero clip to climax at the beat. Experiment. Have fun!\n2. Transition between the clips. If the clips are not shot with transition in mind, any post production transition will feel off. There\u0026rsquo;s only so much you can salvage.\nPersonally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using stock footage. The difficulty is finding good shots that matches what I have in mind. This leads to very robotic, or generic transitions.\n3. Settings are important Video Settings I\u0026rsquo;m using Adobe Premiere Pro. In each seqeuence, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of settings. I barely know what they mean. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m using DNxHD 29.97. Basically, 1080p aspect ratio, 29.97 frame rate.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t take note of the settings for my first video, and the end results ended up being 720px.\nAbout Frames I tried playing around with slowing down of the clips. The clips ended up looking choppy. This is because of \u0026ldquo;missing frames\u0026rdquo;. You can apply Optical Flow, which fills in the missing frame. Cool feature. This makes the slowed down clip looks smoother.\n4. Shortcut Keys Learn them. Extremely useful. Speed up the process. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn them as you work and try things out. When you notice yourself clicking on something over and over again, hover over it and find the name of that button. If there\u0026rsquo;s a short cut key assigned to it, it will show up as well. If not, you can go into the shortcut keys settings and assign that action to a shortcut.\n5. Be Organized Make use of bins (basically folders). You can open folders in multiple tabs.\nKeep sequences separate. When making changes to your sequences, duplicate them. Serves as good back up. You\u0026rsquo;ll always want a point of reference to compare changes. How else would you know the changes are better?\nYou can stack multiple sequences on the timeline panel. This allows you to get parts from one sequence and move it into another. Useful when you are making changes to previous versions.\nUse Adjustment Layers. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to manually make effect changes to each clip.\n6. Try again with fresh perspective I\u0026rsquo;ve structured my 4 hours across 3 days. I\u0026rsquo;ll reflect on my previous work and try to make some improvements on the new video. There is no way a short article or a video will teach you everything.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll have to add in your own takes, your own ideas.\nMy first video was made following a tutorial. My second and third were made based on my own ideas after reflecting on the first video.\n For me, the most impactful lesson is the one about starting with the music. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt this lesson after getting frustrated with finding music that fits the clip. So I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to flip the workflow and it worked better.\nIf I were to make it into a video, the B-Rolls should illustrate the workflow. And I should turn those B-Rolls into GIF for my article.\nIf I want to make it into a story driven video. hmm, sounds overly dramatic. But might be interesting. Let\u0026rsquo;s just try it.\n ","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/video-about-learning-video-editting/","summary":"This video will be a summary of the lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt from video edit.

Job Downgrade This might happen given some conditions.\n WFH stop being the norm. This means that I\u0026rsquo;ll lose about 15 hours per week to commute time. If I am unable to convert the commute time into productive time, then I would consider a job downgrade.  Path 2. Attempt to build alternative income sources The idea is to use my free time to explore alternative income. Some things that stands out for now includes\n Game Development Content Creation  Newsletter Blog Articles Podcast Videos   Creating Applications (bootstrap startup)  Notice, I\u0026rsquo;m not considering things like freelance, tutorial, one-on-one teaching, consulting. Because these are still trading time for money. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m attempting to build stuffs that will give me leverage over time.\nSide Path. Investments The side path is cash inflow, as a result of the money that I\u0026rsquo;ve invested.\nMy current monthly allocation formula is as follow\n Essential Expense = $600 Monthly Balance = Cash Inflow - Essential Expenses Monthly Investment Allocation Amount = Monthly Balance Allocation = 40x + 40y + 20z x: Individual Tech Related Stocks (TSLA, NVDA, PLTR) y: Crypto z: S\u0026amp;P500 z: also serve as \u0026quot;savings\u0026quot; for emergency This is the side path that I\u0026rsquo;m already traveling on, and will continue to travel on. Regardless of which path I choose in the future.\nThe point of the main path, is to increase Cash Inflow, so that my portfolio will grow faster.\nStrategy A quick breakdown of my desired outcome.\n Best Case Scenario, $100k/year. Made indirectly, i.e. not trading my time directly for money.  this could be through code, content, employees, etc   End Goal is to have full control over my time  What are some tactics / actions that I can use to achieve the above outcome?\n Writing as a Form of Thinking (Written Content) Writing Notes (Written Content) Notes -\u0026gt; Podcast (Audio Content) Podcast as Voiceover + B-Rolls -\u0026gt; Videos (Video Content) Writing Visual Notes (Image Content) Writing Code (Code Content) -\u0026gt; Guide (Written Content) -\u0026gt; Podcast (Audio Content)  Guide + Diagrams (Image Content) Podcast + Diagrams + B-Rolls -\u0026gt; Videos (Video Content)    What are the fundamental actions?\n Read Write Synthesize Voiceover Video Creation Coding (just by continue working, I would keep using this skill without thought) Image Design Diagrams and Illustrations Teaching (guide-based content) -\u0026gt; this sounds like the first skill I should work on developing. I feel like this is a low hanging fruit. Furthermore, this can mesh well with the learning that I will be embarking on. Story Telling Idea Generation Market Validation Marketing Selling Communication  The above would be the core pillars that will make me into a person that can bring in $100k/year.\nRight now, coding is the sole skill that can bring in majority of the income. If I double down on that, it would require me to create stuffs that people would need. i.e. solving problems.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/a-loose-strategy/","summary":"The key takeaway from Atomic Habits, is to build small habits that compounds.

I will not process them yet. Basically this is the ground work to help me absorb the information.\nChapter 1 Key Concepts\nWhat if you grow 1% compounded daily?    Days Years Factor     365 1 37   730 2 1427   1095 3 53,939   1460 4 2,038,007    Quoting James Clear\n \u0026ldquo;The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.\u0026rdquo;\n The thesis is to build small habits and get them to compound, making you a better person.\nPersonal Thoughts: I agree with this argument, improving every day is better than deteoriating every day. The compounding chart is there to serve as a visual. A Hook.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it is meant to be a definite fact.\nAlthough my friends are going crazy over this. The same way they go crazy over the potential of making 1% return daily on the Forex courses they are hearing about. Pretty sure it might be a logical fallacy. Need to read up about it.\nPlateau Most progression are non-linear, although people expects them to be. This leads to a period where the progress falls below expectations. James Clear coin that difference - \u0026ldquo;Valley of Disappointment\u0026rdquo;.\nSeth Godin call this \u0026ldquo;The Dip\u0026rdquo;. Basically, in all endeavors worth pursuing, there will be a period of drought where there will be no results, in fact, you might even be bleeding during those period.\nIn both cases, getting through the Dip or the Valley of Disappointment is crucial. Cause that is where the rewards lies.\nWhat I took from Seth Godin\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Dip\u0026rdquo;, is that you\u0026rsquo;ll need resources, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have opportunity costs for choosing to go through the Dip. And if you are unable to go through the Dip, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up wasting a whole lot of resources.\nJames Clear take is that all valley of disappointments can be overcomed, through a system of habit.\nProblems with Goals Winners and Losers have the Same Goals hmm, do they not have the same system too? or similar systems.\nAchieving Goal is ONLY Momentary It\u0026rsquo;s like reaching a milestone. Now what?\nGoals Restrict Happiness On the assumption that \u0026ldquo;once I reach my goal, then I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy\u0026rdquo;\nGoals are at Odds with Long-term Progress Goals can create a yo-yo effect. Work hard. Achieve Goal. Now what? Revert to Old Habits.\nAlthough, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this means don\u0026rsquo;t set goals. Goals are still necessary for setting some form of direction. To elicit some level of clarity. It\u0026rsquo;s just that goals alone will not be enough. The first step is to set your goals. The next step, is to consider what systems can be put in place to help you achieve those goals.\nThe thesis of this book, seems to be centered around habits. Build the correct habits that will come together and make you into a person that can make the goal a reality.\nSystem of Atomic Habits A system, of small, tiny changes, marginal gains, 1 percent improvements, that adds up into dramatic change.\nChapter 2 Habits and Identity and Habits. It\u0026rsquo;s a cycle. Habits shapes identity. Identity shapes habit.\n3 Layers of Behavior Change Outcomes The results. Things like losing weight, publish a book, winning. Most goals are results-oriented. Especially if you set goals using the SMART framework. Just being \u0026ldquo;Specific\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Measurable\u0026rdquo; requires you to set something that is result oriented.\nProcess Habits and System. The focus of the book. Basically, about your actions and environment.\nIdentity Worldview. Beliefs. Self-image. Assumptions. This reminds me of Anthony Robbins. I remembered reading something about human desire to be congruent with their personal identity. A quick search bring up this video clip. I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably in the book Personal Power or Awaken the Giant Within.\nChanging Your Identity  Decide the type of person you want to be Prove it with small wins  The part about proving with small wins, is to create evidence that will reinforce your beliefs about yourself. Recall when you take MBTI, you are basically asked multiple questions about how you would approach or what you have recently done in various hypothetical scenario.\nHow do you answer those questions? By seeking references to evidences in your mind. And you rationalize it by the frequency of those evidences.\nWhy Habits Matter They give you evidences that will support your new identity.\nChapter 3 4 Steps to Building Better Habits\nAbout Habit Loops 1. Cue In NLP, they call this the anchor. In operant conditioning, they call this the stimulus. For our brain to learn the cue, they would need to be exposed to the entire chain. Cue, Action, Reward. Repeated enough time, it will become automatic.\nI think studies has shown that this loop could be broken down over time by deteoriation. Need to find the reference material for confirmation\u0026hellip;\n2. Craving James Clear define this as the motivation force. It\u0026rsquo;s basically the anticipation of the rewards. I think that\u0026rsquo;s where Dopamine kicks in. You don\u0026rsquo;t really control this. This is neuroscience territory. Video from Dr K About Dopamine Dopamine are what our brain uses to reinforce the behavior that is rewarding.\n3. Response Basically the action, in response to the cue. This only happens if the cue is anchored to some form of anticipation of reward. The exact action you take, is in hope of attaining the reward.\n4. Reward Basically the outcomes of the action.\n \u0026ldquo;Rewards are the end goal of every habit\u0026rdquo;\n In short, the entire loop from cue to reward, which then reinforces the craving, will lead to sticky habits.\n4 Laws of Behavior Change     Cue Craving Response Reward     Creating Good Habit Make cue obvious Make it attractive Make action easy Make reward satisfying   Breaking Bad Habits Make cue invisible Make it unattractive Make it difficult to take action Make it unsatisfying    My Thoughts From my superficial understanding of Neuroscience, I think it might be impossible to control \u0026ldquo;Cravings\u0026rdquo; directly. I would think Cravings would be a dependent variable. Rewards would be potential independent variables. Although in such cases, what we really want to achieve is to change the response. Or to control the response.\nWhen we think about habits, we probably have this idealized vision of being able to \u0026ldquo;run effortlessly every day\u0026rdquo;. The part about running effortlessly every day is the response, the desired action.\nI would also argue that habits could be form without massive repetitions, although those might have various confounders which makes it not so replicable.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll just leave a counter example. An anecdote, but still a counter example.\nI have a friend who has never smoked in his life. He tried it once, and immediately got hooked. He ended up becoming a chain smoker. If habits requires multiple repetitions, how did he build such a sticky habit in a single repetition?\nExamples and Action Plans The rest of the chapters (4 to 17) focus on research and stories, with examples of action plans. I\u0026rsquo;ll just take notes on those that stood out.\n Habits Scorecard  inspired by the \u0026ldquo;Pointing-and-Calling\u0026rdquo; system, designed to reduce mistakes I have experience working in critical environments, where a single mistake can cause tremendous loss. In those environments, we always have a set of checklist.  Checklist prevents people from making mistakes. It forces us to focus on each detail.   James Clear suggested the usage of habits scorecard to raise our awareness. This is indeed a very useful way to do so. Habits Scorecard, Checklists, such tools are useful to build mindfulness   Implementation Intention Formula  I will [DO SOMETHING] at [SPECIFIC TIME] in [SPECIFIC LOCATION]   Habit Stacking  after habit 1, I will do habit 2   Environment over Motivation  you can design your environment to make it trigger desirable actions/habits   Remove cues to undesirable habits  Conclusion Build a ton of small habits, they will stack up and make you a new person.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/atomic-habits-notes-v2/","summary":"Level 1 Reading, to me is the extraction of information.

They are essentially implying everyone will become million and billionaires in 1 year, depending on X and Y.\nThe numbers make sense. The logic seems to make sense. But does the whole thing make sense?\nOne thing that stood out is the \u0026ldquo;Law of Marginal Aggregation\u0026rdquo;. I think this is the thing that gets misused. As a magical system that gives everyone 37x gains in a year with small effort.\nTour De France Stats Reference: https://www.letour.fr/en/history\n   Year Stages Distance (km) 1st Place Finish Time Number of GBR in top 10 Notes     2012 20 3497 87H 34' 47'' 2 Team Sky 1st place   2013 21 3404 83H 56' 40'' 1 Team Sky 1st place   2014 21 3659 89H 59' 06'' 0    2015 21 3354 84H 46' 14'' 0    2016 21 3525 89H 04' 48'' 1 Team Sky 1st place   2017 21 3540 86H 20' 55'' 2 Team Sky 1st place   2018 21 3349 83H 17' 13'' 2 Team Sky 1st place   2019 21 3366 82H 57' 00'' 1    2020 21 3483 87H 20' 05'' 1     I look up the stats to convince myself that Team Sky is indeed doing something right. The results shows true. You need to be doing something right to get 1st place 5/9 times. This gives credibility to the Law of Marginal Aggregation.\nHow do we apply Law of Marginal Aggregation? First, identify all possible actions that could potentially be related to the desired outcome.\nA mind map sounds like the most intuitive way to do this.\n![[Pasted image 20211018063629.png]]\nWe can start by thinking about the obvious things. To win a cycling race, what the the obvious components? The cyclist and the bicycle. And then we can think of the different components that makes up each of them, and the potential components that would affect the end result.\nAnd as you branch out into the various components and factors, you\u0026rsquo;ll eventually reach a point where you can no longer fan out further. i.e. you have arrived at all the atomic parts of the system.\nStrategy to Build The Habits  Build a new Identity Build a new Belief System Strengthen them with new Evidences Gain New Evidence by Tracking your Actions  When I think about Identity, the first thing that pops into mind is the Myers Briggs Type Indicator.\n**How does most of these indicator works? **\nYou answer a questionaire about yourself. You answer them based on what you think is the most correct answer.\nHow did you make the choice about those answers?\nBy referring to your memory of specific events and your actions, and thoughts, in those specific events.\nQuestion. Are these our \u0026ldquo;Natural Tendencies\u0026rdquo;, or are these our \u0026ldquo;Comfortable Tendencies\u0026rdquo;? Or maybe, are these our \u0026ldquo;Most Frequent/Common/Memorable Tendencies?\u0026rdquo;\nPersonal Action Plan 1. Goals Setting I will still start from goals. Goals are there as a guiding point, towards some concrete direction. Become healthier for the sake of health doesn\u0026rsquo;t evoke much emotions, neither is it inspiring. Become healthier because I want to live longer and be with my family for as long as humanly possible is much more inspiring.\n2. Factors Brainstorm Of course, we do not stop at goals setting. Next step, would be to think about the different components and factors that will relate to the goal. For example, health naturally is a result of what you eat and what you do with your body. The obvious components (maybe direct) are \u0026ldquo;Nutrition\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Exercise\u0026rdquo;. Not so obvious components (indirect) could be sleep, environment, amount of sunlight.\n3. Identity Identification Then, I should identify existing beliefs about myself and what are the evidences that forms my beliefs about that identity. And whether these identities and beliefs are in conflict with my goals. Whether if there\u0026rsquo;s any obvious alignment between the factors with my existing beliefs.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s alignment, the change should come easy. Else, I would need to work on building new identities.\n4. Gathering Evidences The easiest form of gathering evidence, is to further breakdown the identity into smaller components. Alongside the existing evidences you have. To break your existing identity, you simply need to offer counter evidences.\nIf you belief yourself to be fat, and that is supported by evidence of desire for sweet food. A simple counter example is to throw away the sweet food you have. Or to give them away.\nThrowing them away reinforce the idea that you think sweet food are trash. Giving them away reinforce the idea that you value your friends more than your sweet tooth, maybe.\nEach time you create a new counter evidence, record it. This serve as a tangible evidence that is way stronger than your memory about old evidences.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/atomic-habits-notes/","summary":"The thing that I often hear about Atomic Habits, is the system that gives you 37x growth in a year.\nWhen I hear about 1% improvements, compounded across the year, I thought it sounded difficult to improve in the samething 1% daily.

The social network that I used are those that my friends are using. Started off with Friendster and Hi5, and then ended with Facebook. We would scan our year book onto the computer and use those as our profile pictures. Or we would befriend people who have access to camera and ask them for a custom photo. Web Gaming.

Tool 24 about working from a plan stood out to me.\nMinimum Viable Writing In the book, Roy cited an interesting example. About readings being able to get the story and the gist of the writing, the essential parts of the writing, from the headings and subheadings alone.\nIn other words, from headings and subheadings, we can quickly determine if the idea presented would be valuable, or not.\nThis reminds me of the concept of Minimum Viable Product in Software.\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP) in Software MVP in the software world, is the bare essential software that can be used for user testing. The idea is to quickly get feedback from the users so that you can improve on the software. This is to prevent resource wastage that comes from building a software that nobody want or need.\nHeadings and Subheadings In Software, the basic functionalities that aims to solve a problem is the litmus test. In writing, the headings and subheadings seems like a useful litmus test.\nIteration from Feedback and Data I think an easy way to implement this, is through code that will track data about page views. Page view data across multiple set of headings and subheadings. And maybe a clickthrough button that allows readers to read more about the Outline.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/minimum-viable-writing/","summary":"I was reading \u0026ldquo;Writing Tools\u0026rdquo; by Roy Peter Clark, to gain some insights that will help me write better.

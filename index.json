I think my biggest obstacle, is that the task is too big. It\u0026rsquo;s so big, that it is overwhelming.\nFirst Resolution I eventually decided to do the simplest thing. Just choose a random video about video edit, and follow along. Even if it\u0026rsquo;s just going through the motions, it is fine. Just get started.\nAfter going through the motion, I managed to get a loose grasp of the components in the video edit process.\nAbstraction of Process  Choosing the Clips Triming the Clips Making a Sequence from those Clips  This is the bare minimum process in making a video. It will be pretty basics, but it is a video.\nSo that\u0026rsquo;s my first experiment, try to make a video using these 3 steps.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve went back to the tutorial and took notes of the steps, the process, where the different buttons are on the editting tool, what the shortcuts are, make a cheat sheet, and start on my first experiment.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrUc7GaoAA\nIt took 2 hours. From creating the new Adobe Premiere Pro Project to exporting. The whole process took 2 hours.\nSelf Reflection After creating my first video. Or rather, just a simple sequence. Now I have a reference point. I have something that I can analyse and critique. I have something that I can reflect on. And that\u0026rsquo;s what I did.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve only realized my first video was in 720p after uploading it on YouTube. Turns out I didn\u0026rsquo;t set the correct settings! It\u0026rsquo;s a minor thing.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t learn it from the tutorial. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing it\u0026rsquo;s something that seasoned creators do habitually.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t learn the intricacies from watching. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn them from doing and experiencing.\nApart from the technical aspect, there\u0026rsquo;s also the creative aspect. How does the sequence felt? How does the clips flow? How is the end product? This part is subjective.\nMy first idea is to add transition. The abrupt cut from one clip to another felt weird. My second idea is to pay more attention to the music. I choose a music without much thought and it just felt off.\nExtending the Process In my next video, I experimented with transitions. It looked fine when editing, but re-watching it after publishing, I felt that adding the transition reduce the quality of the end product.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcXv1gw3SHU\nAt least now I learn about transitions and experimented with it. I also learnt that you should render the video before previewing.\nRepeat. Go through the iterations. I\u0026rsquo;ve started with a 3 step process. Then I reflected on my output. Find ways to improve the product. Refine the process. Remember the mistakes.\nHabit Loop Trigger Action Reward\nRight now, the reward is the growth. Getting better and better at each try. This is the greatest feeling for me now.\nThe trigger, is looking at my previous reflection. My reflection at the end of each cycle list down key action points. I simply act on those action points. This might be a problem. If I can\u0026rsquo;t think of anything specific to improve, then my trigger would be lost.\nIt could be improvement, or it could be extension into another idea.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/outline-to-draft/","summary":"5 Days of Video Edit\nEssence of the Video About starting something difficult.

In the past 3 videos. 4 hours of lessons. Not that much. But 4 hours ahead of anyone who haven\u0026rsquo;t started.\n1. Start from the music. It is a lot easier to make the clips fit the music. Compare to making the music fit the clips. If the music is a moody music, you can use LUTs to immediately apply a \u0026ldquo;moody\u0026rdquo; tone to all the clips. e.g. blue wash the video. You can also add additional sound effects to strengthen the mood.\nMost importantly, musics have their own set of rhythm and melody. It is easier to cut the clips to fit the rhythm of the music.\nEdit transitions to the beat might seems cool. But overdoing it will make the video predictable. In other words, boring. Maybe change up the beat. Maybe sync the hero clip to climax at the beat. Experiment. Have fun!\n2. Transition between the clips. If the clips are not shot with transition in mind, any post production transition will feel off. There\u0026rsquo;s only so much you can salvage.\nPersonally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been using stock footage. The difficulty is finding good shots that matches what I have in mind. This leads to very robotic, or generic transitions.\n3. Settings are important Video Settings I\u0026rsquo;m using Adobe Premiere Pro. In each seqeuence, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of settings. I barely know what they mean. For now, I\u0026rsquo;m using DNxHD 29.97. Basically, 1080p aspect ratio, 29.97 frame rate.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t take note of the settings for my first video, and the end results ended up being 720px.\nAbout Frames I tried playing around with slowing down of the clips. The clips ended up looking choppy. This is because of \u0026ldquo;missing frames\u0026rdquo;. You can apply Optical Flow, which fills in the missing frame. Cool feature. This makes the slowed down clip looks smoother.\n4. Shortcut Keys Learn them. Extremely useful. Speed up the process. You\u0026rsquo;ll learn them as you work and try things out. When you notice yourself clicking on something over and over again, hover over it and find the name of that button. If there\u0026rsquo;s a short cut key assigned to it, it will show up as well. If not, you can go into the shortcut keys settings and assign that action to a shortcut.\n5. Be Organized Make use of bins (basically folders). You can open folders in multiple tabs.\nKeep sequences separate. When making changes to your sequences, duplicate them. Serves as good back up. You\u0026rsquo;ll always want a point of reference to compare changes. How else would you know the changes are better?\nYou can stack multiple sequences on the timeline panel. This allows you to get parts from one sequence and move it into another. Useful when you are making changes to previous versions.\nUse Adjustment Layers. You don\u0026rsquo;t want to manually make effect changes to each clip.\n6. Try again with fresh perspective I\u0026rsquo;ve structured my 4 hours across 3 days. I\u0026rsquo;ll reflect on my previous work and try to make some improvements on the new video. There is no way a short article or a video will teach you everything.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll have to add in your own takes, your own ideas.\nMy first video was made following a tutorial. My second and third were made based on my own ideas after reflecting on the first video.\n For me, the most impactful lesson is the one about starting with the music. I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt this lesson after getting frustrated with finding music that fits the clip. So I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to flip the workflow and it worked better.\nIf I were to make it into a video, the B-Rolls should illustrate the workflow. And I should turn those B-Rolls into GIF for my article.\nIf I want to make it into a story driven video. hmm, sounds overly dramatic. But might be interesting. Let\u0026rsquo;s just try it.\n ","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/video-about-learning-video-editting/","summary":"This video will be a summary of the lessons I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt from video edit.

So that you will grow into a person, with a new identity. An identity that will bring you the results you desire.\nNow then, this is the fun part, coming up with a strategy and action plan.\nBefore I\u0026rsquo;ve set up my website, I was writing on substack. In that article, I\u0026rsquo;ve set some financial goals.\nIdeal Lifestyle Financial goals based around the lifestyle that I desire. My ideal lifestyle consist of the following\n 3 days of tennis each week, on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday A house worth SGD $1.5m, based on the research I\u0026rsquo;ve done then 10 days of Travel each year, to Japan  To achieve that lifestyle, I would need to first accumulate about $375,000 + $5,000 = $380,000 for the upfront payment. And I would need to be able to pay $68,295 + $10,000 + $7,786 = $86,081/year.\nAssume that I only inflat my lifestyle for the above 3 points, my basic living expenses would remain at $600/month = $7,200 / year. This brings me to a total of $93,281 / year. Or $7,774/month.\nMy current annual compensation is approximately $70,200 - $83,700. (range given to hide my salary, also to account for the variable components in my compensation package)\n    Upfront Annual Outflow Monthly Outflow     Top-end luxury with all my current desires fulfilled $430k $94k $7.8k   In-between ($600k house) $200k $44k $3.6k   Minimalistic Lifestyle $50k (debt) $7.2k $600    Figures are rounded up\nDifferent Paths The main paths are concern with cash inflow that occurs as a result of the value that I created.\nPath 1. Just remain on my path If I were to simply stay on my current path, I could achieve my \u0026ldquo;In-between\u0026rdquo; lifestyle in about 5 years without much effort. Although that would force me to remain on the same path for another 15-20 years.\nMy current path is\n A single stream of income Continue my minimalistic lifestyle Continue trading my time for money  Path 1b. Job Hopping. This is pretty much a proven strategy, but fundamentally, nothing changes. At this point, I still like my job at Shopee.\nPath 1c. Job Downgrade This might happen given some conditions.\n WFH stop being the norm. This means that I\u0026rsquo;ll lose about 15 hours per week to commute time. If I am unable to convert the commute time into productive time, then I would consider a job downgrade.  Path 2. Attempt to build alternative income sources The idea is to use my free time to explore alternative income. Some things that stands out for now includes\n Game Development Content Creation  Newsletter Blog Articles Podcast Videos   Creating Applications (bootstrap startup)  Notice, I\u0026rsquo;m not considering things like freelance, tutorial, one-on-one teaching, consulting. Because these are still trading time for money. Right now, I\u0026rsquo;m attempting to build stuffs that will give me leverage over time.\nSide Path. Investments The side path is cash inflow, as a result of the money that I\u0026rsquo;ve invested.\nMy current monthly allocation formula is as follow\n Essential Expense = $600 Monthly Balance = Cash Inflow - Essential Expenses Monthly Investment Allocation Amount = Monthly Balance Allocation = 40x + 40y + 20z x: Individual Tech Related Stocks (TSLA, NVDA, PLTR) y: Crypto z: S\u0026amp;P500 z: also serve as \u0026quot;savings\u0026quot; for emergency This is the side path that I\u0026rsquo;m already traveling on, and will continue to travel on. Regardless of which path I choose in the future.\nThe point of the main path, is to increase Cash Inflow, so that my portfolio will grow faster.\nStrategy A quick breakdown of my desired outcome.\n Best Case Scenario, $100k/year. Made indirectly, i.e. not trading my time directly for money.  this could be through code, content, employees, etc   End Goal is to have full control over my time  What are some tactics / actions that I can use to achieve the above outcome?\n Writing as a Form of Thinking (Written Content) Writing Notes (Written Content) Notes -\u0026gt; Podcast (Audio Content) Podcast as Voiceover + B-Rolls -\u0026gt; Videos (Video Content) Writing Visual Notes (Image Content) Writing Code (Code Content) -\u0026gt; Guide (Written Content) -\u0026gt; Podcast (Audio Content)  Guide + Diagrams (Image Content) Podcast + Diagrams + B-Rolls -\u0026gt; Videos (Video Content)    What are the fundamental actions?\n Read Write Synthesize Voiceover Video Creation Coding (just by continue working, I would keep using this skill without thought) Image Design Diagrams and Illustrations Teaching (guide-based content) -\u0026gt; this sounds like the first skill I should work on developing. I feel like this is a low hanging fruit. Furthermore, this can mesh well with the learning that I will be embarking on. Story Telling Idea Generation Market Validation Marketing Selling Communication  The above would be the core pillars that will make me into a person that can bring in $100k/year.\nRight now, coding is the sole skill that can bring in majority of the income. If I double down on that, it would require me to create stuffs that people would need. i.e. solving problems.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/a-loose-strategy/","summary":"The key takeaway from Atomic Habits, is to build small habits that compounds.

I will not process them yet. Basically this is the ground work to help me absorb the information.\nChapter 1 Key Concepts\nWhat if you grow 1% compounded daily?    Days Years Factor     365 1 37   730 2 1427   1095 3 53,939   1460 4 2,038,007    Quoting James Clear\n \u0026ldquo;The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day, you’ll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.\u0026rdquo;\n The thesis is to build small habits and get them to compound, making you a better person.\nPersonal Thoughts: I agree with this argument, improving every day is better than deteoriating every day. The compounding chart is there to serve as a visual. A Hook.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t think it is meant to be a definite fact.\nAlthough my friends are going crazy over this. The same way they go crazy over the potential of making 1% return daily on the Forex courses they are hearing about. Pretty sure it might be a logical fallacy. Need to read up about it.\nPlateau Most progression are non-linear, although people expects them to be. This leads to a period where the progress falls below expectations. James Clear coin that difference - \u0026ldquo;Valley of Disappointment\u0026rdquo;.\nSeth Godin call this \u0026ldquo;The Dip\u0026rdquo;. Basically, in all endeavors worth pursuing, there will be a period of drought where there will be no results, in fact, you might even be bleeding during those period.\nIn both cases, getting through the Dip or the Valley of Disappointment is crucial. Cause that is where the rewards lies.\nWhat I took from Seth Godin\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Dip\u0026rdquo;, is that you\u0026rsquo;ll need resources, and you\u0026rsquo;ll have opportunity costs for choosing to go through the Dip. And if you are unable to go through the Dip, you\u0026rsquo;ll end up wasting a whole lot of resources.\nJames Clear take is that all valley of disappointments can be overcomed, through a system of habit.\nProblems with Goals Winners and Losers have the Same Goals hmm, do they not have the same system too? or similar systems.\nAchieving Goal is ONLY Momentary It\u0026rsquo;s like reaching a milestone. Now what?\nGoals Restrict Happiness On the assumption that \u0026ldquo;once I reach my goal, then I\u0026rsquo;ll be happy\u0026rdquo;\nGoals are at Odds with Long-term Progress Goals can create a yo-yo effect. Work hard. Achieve Goal. Now what? Revert to Old Habits.\nAlthough, I don\u0026rsquo;t think this means don\u0026rsquo;t set goals. Goals are still necessary for setting some form of direction. To elicit some level of clarity. It\u0026rsquo;s just that goals alone will not be enough. The first step is to set your goals. The next step, is to consider what systems can be put in place to help you achieve those goals.\nThe thesis of this book, seems to be centered around habits. Build the correct habits that will come together and make you into a person that can make the goal a reality.\nSystem of Atomic Habits A system, of small, tiny changes, marginal gains, 1 percent improvements, that adds up into dramatic change.\nChapter 2 Habits and Identity and Habits. It\u0026rsquo;s a cycle. Habits shapes identity. Identity shapes habit.\n3 Layers of Behavior Change Outcomes The results. Things like losing weight, publish a book, winning. Most goals are results-oriented. Especially if you set goals using the SMART framework. Just being \u0026ldquo;Specific\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Measurable\u0026rdquo; requires you to set something that is result oriented.\nProcess Habits and System. The focus of the book. Basically, about your actions and environment.\nIdentity Worldview. Beliefs. Self-image. Assumptions. This reminds me of Anthony Robbins. I remembered reading something about human desire to be congruent with their personal identity. A quick search bring up this video clip. I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably in the book Personal Power or Awaken the Giant Within.\nChanging Your Identity  Decide the type of person you want to be Prove it with small wins  The part about proving with small wins, is to create evidence that will reinforce your beliefs about yourself. Recall when you take MBTI, you are basically asked multiple questions about how you would approach or what you have recently done in various hypothetical scenario.\nHow do you answer those questions? By seeking references to evidences in your mind. And you rationalize it by the frequency of those evidences.\nWhy Habits Matter They give you evidences that will support your new identity.\nChapter 3 4 Steps to Building Better Habits\nAbout Habit Loops 1. Cue In NLP, they call this the anchor. In operant conditioning, they call this the stimulus. For our brain to learn the cue, they would need to be exposed to the entire chain. Cue, Action, Reward. Repeated enough time, it will become automatic.\nI think studies has shown that this loop could be broken down over time by deteoriation. Need to find the reference material for confirmation\u0026hellip;\n2. Craving James Clear define this as the motivation force. It\u0026rsquo;s basically the anticipation of the rewards. I think that\u0026rsquo;s where Dopamine kicks in. You don\u0026rsquo;t really control this. This is neuroscience territory. Video from Dr K About Dopamine Dopamine are what our brain uses to reinforce the behavior that is rewarding.\n3. Response Basically the action, in response to the cue. This only happens if the cue is anchored to some form of anticipation of reward. The exact action you take, is in hope of attaining the reward.\n4. Reward Basically the outcomes of the action.\n \u0026ldquo;Rewards are the end goal of every habit\u0026rdquo;\n In short, the entire loop from cue to reward, which then reinforces the craving, will lead to sticky habits.\n4 Laws of Behavior Change     Cue Craving Response Reward     Creating Good Habit Make cue obvious Make it attractive Make action easy Make reward satisfying   Breaking Bad Habits Make cue invisible Make it unattractive Make it difficult to take action Make it unsatisfying    My Thoughts From my superficial understanding of Neuroscience, I think it might be impossible to control \u0026ldquo;Cravings\u0026rdquo; directly. I would think Cravings would be a dependent variable. Rewards would be potential independent variables. Although in such cases, what we really want to achieve is to change the response. Or to control the response.\nWhen we think about habits, we probably have this idealized vision of being able to \u0026ldquo;run effortlessly every day\u0026rdquo;. The part about running effortlessly every day is the response, the desired action.\nI would also argue that habits could be form without massive repetitions, although those might have various confounders which makes it not so replicable.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll just leave a counter example. An anecdote, but still a counter example.\nI have a friend who has never smoked in his life. He tried it once, and immediately got hooked. He ended up becoming a chain smoker. If habits requires multiple repetitions, how did he build such a sticky habit in a single repetition?\nExamples and Action Plans The rest of the chapters (4 to 17) focus on research and stories, with examples of action plans. I\u0026rsquo;ll just take notes on those that stood out.\n Habits Scorecard  inspired by the \u0026ldquo;Pointing-and-Calling\u0026rdquo; system, designed to reduce mistakes I have experience working in critical environments, where a single mistake can cause tremendous loss. In those environments, we always have a set of checklist.  Checklist prevents people from making mistakes. It forces us to focus on each detail.   James Clear suggested the usage of habits scorecard to raise our awareness. This is indeed a very useful way to do so. Habits Scorecard, Checklists, such tools are useful to build mindfulness   Implementation Intention Formula  I will [DO SOMETHING] at [SPECIFIC TIME] in [SPECIFIC LOCATION]   Habit Stacking  after habit 1, I will do habit 2   Environment over Motivation  you can design your environment to make it trigger desirable actions/habits   Remove cues to undesirable habits  Conclusion Build a ton of small habits, they will stack up and make you a new person.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/atomic-habits-notes-v2/","summary":"Level 1 Reading, to me is the extraction of information.

First, identify all possible actions that could potentially be related to the desired outcome.\nA mind map sounds like the most intuitive way to do this.\n![[Pasted image 20211018063629.png]]\nWe can start by thinking about the obvious things. To win a cycling race, what the the obvious components? The cyclist and the bicycle. And then we can think of the different components that makes up each of them, and the potential components that would affect the end result.\nAnd as you branch out into the various components and factors, you\u0026rsquo;ll eventually reach a point where you can no longer fan out further. i.e. you have arrived at all the atomic parts of the system.\nStrategy to Build The Habits  Build a new Identity Build a new Belief System Strengthen them with new Evidences Gain New Evidence by Tracking your Actions  When I think about Identity, the first thing that pops into mind is the Myers Briggs Type Indicator.\n**How does most of these indicator works? **\nYou answer a questionaire about yourself. You answer them based on what you think is the most correct answer.\nHow did you make the choice about those answers?\nBy referring to your memory of specific events and your actions, and thoughts, in those specific events.\nQuestion. Are these our \u0026ldquo;Natural Tendencies\u0026rdquo;, or are these our \u0026ldquo;Comfortable Tendencies\u0026rdquo;? Or maybe, are these our \u0026ldquo;Most Frequent/Common/Memorable Tendencies?\u0026rdquo;\nPersonal Action Plan 1. Goals Setting I will still start from goals. Goals are there as a guiding point, towards some concrete direction. Become healthier for the sake of health doesn\u0026rsquo;t evoke much emotions, neither is it inspiring. Become healthier because I want to live longer and be with my family for as long as humanly possible is much more inspiring.\n2. Factors Brainstorm Of course, we do not stop at goals setting. Next step, would be to think about the different components and factors that will relate to the goal. For example, health naturally is a result of what you eat and what you do with your body. The obvious components (maybe direct) are \u0026ldquo;Nutrition\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Exercise\u0026rdquo;. Not so obvious components (indirect) could be sleep, environment, amount of sunlight.\n3. Identity Identification Then, I should identify existing beliefs about myself and what are the evidences that forms my beliefs about that identity. And whether these identities and beliefs are in conflict with my goals. Whether if there\u0026rsquo;s any obvious alignment between the factors with my existing beliefs.\nIf there\u0026rsquo;s alignment, the change should come easy. Else, I would need to work on building new identities.\n4. Gathering Evidences The easiest form of gathering evidence, is to further breakdown the identity into smaller components. Alongside the existing evidences you have. To break your existing identity, you simply need to offer counter evidences.\nIf you belief yourself to be fat, and that is supported by evidence of desire for sweet food. A simple counter example is to throw away the sweet food you have. Or to give them away.\nThrowing them away reinforce the idea that you think sweet food are trash. Giving them away reinforce the idea that you value your friends more than your sweet tooth, maybe.\nEach time you create a new counter evidence, record it. This serve as a tangible evidence that is way stronger than your memory about old evidences.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/atomic-habits-notes/","summary":"The thing that I often hear about Atomic Habits, is the system that gives you 37x growth in a year.\nWhen I hear about 1% improvements, compounded across the year, I thought it sounded difficult to improve in the samething 1% daily.

This is my first memory of interaction with the internet. We visit websites by going straight to the domain names. I remember entering random domain names to see where they will bring me. I remember seeing domain names on television and posters. This is the era where we still lived mainly in the physical world. Search Engines. This is when we are able to discover new websites easily. Blogs. This is the era where we would put links to our friends blogs. Where we would share updates of our lives, mainly through text. There\u0026rsquo;s no smart phones. So it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to have access to pictures. Social Media. This is when we started sharing a portion of ourselves online. And seeing a curated snippets of other people\u0026rsquo;s lives. The social network that I used are those that my friends are using. Started off with Friendster and Hi5, and then ended with Facebook. We would scan our year book onto the computer and use those as our profile pictures. Or we would befriend people who have access to camera and ask them for a custom photo. Web Gaming. Social Media Gaming. Smart Phones. Mobile Gaming. Photo Sharing. Everyone with a smartphone can easily take pictures and share them. Videos Sharing and Streaming. People can also take videos and share them easily. Live Streaming. As network improves, live streaming becomes a reality. Online Purchases (this happens earlier, it\u0026rsquo;s just that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t 18 yet, so I didn\u0026rsquo;t have a card for transactions) Blockchain. NFT NFT Gaming  Hmm, is my life simply tied to gaming, or is gaming usually one of the first few use cases of new technology?\nSocial Media games make it so that people can compete and flaunt their progress.

And when you see YouTubers breakdown their income, it typically contains the following components:\n  YouTube Adsense\n  Affiliate Sales\n  Sponsorship\n  Merchandise\n  Authenticity The most authentic content creators, or those that deserves our continued trust, are those that choose to reject monetization that goes against their “policy” or their “values”.\nIn other words, something that does not align with the initial “permission”.\n Authentic Content Creators, are those that stick to their ongoing value proposition. Usually, the same value proposition that compels us to subscribe to them in the first place.\n As content consumers, the permission that we give to marketers, are in the form of subscription, opt-ins, registration, follows, etc.\nAnd usually, the reason we do so is one of the following:\n  We think the Content Creator would deliver more information\n  We think the Content Creator would continue to entertain us\n  We are simply signing up for a sweepstake, lottery, giveaway\n  Niche If permission marketing is about consistently delivery on a promise of value, then niche, is the scope of the value which we will be delivering on.\nRather than thinking of niche as a topic, I think it would be more apt to think of niche as a problem. Because inherently, problems are worth more than information.\nEspecially if the problem is chronic.\nWhat would be my niche?\nMy goal is to achieve financial freedom, as defined through my ideal lifestyle in a prior post. And my content is the documentation of my knowledge gained in this journey. The experimentation. The learnings. The failures. The successes.\nIf I were to scope this into a value proposition, how would it sound like?\n Subscribe, if you want to follow me on my financial journey. Starting as a fresh graduate in 50k debt towards financial freedom, defined as a life where I have full control over my time, and the ability to enjoy my hobbies and dreams.\n What would be the expectations the consumers have in mind?\n  I want to see where this kid goes, I want to see his failures so I can avoid them, I want to see his successes, so I can copy them\n  I want to see the knowledge summary that he makes, so I can save time from reading the books\n  I want to see his action plan, so I can copy and adapt to my own needs\n  I want to know what he did correctly, so I am reassured that the choice is “safe” and would lead to success\n  I want to see his rags to riches story, so I can get inspired, cause I am on the same journey\n  What are the possible underlying problems in the above expectations?\n  Fear of Uncertainty\n  Desire for Stability\n  Lack of information about the journey ahead\n  The first thing that comes into mind, is the fear of uncertainty. It is a scary journey. We could hedge it, if it is a side hustle.\nImagine being a fresh graduate, having this idea, this dream, but also being shackled by a huge student loan debt.\nIt would take someone crazy to pursue all these dreams and ideals rather than simply taking a stable job. Which is pretty much what I’ve chose to do.\nMonetization This is something that I thought about, and something that I was afraid of in the past. And also the same reason why I decided to take on a job as an analyst instead of marketer when I graduate from Business School.\nUltimately, it feels like I am self-serving, for delivering value just for the sake of getting value.\nBut isn’t that how the world works? I am working on my job so that I can get paid. Likewise, I will be creating content, so that I can get paid.\nMaking money through AdSense might make it seem less direct, but it is still payment.\nI think, what I need to do to overcome this limiting belief, would be the following.\n  Commit to over deliver. I need to make sure that those who choose to follow me, will get more out of the relationship than I did.\n  Take responsibility for my content.

It works well in helping me save and invest.\nAnd after reaching the limits of saving and investment. The new question that pops up in my mind, is how can I make more?\n This article, serves as a self-reflection. A “Thinking in Public” type of article.\nWhy the obsession with money? This is what I want to find out, but simply asking this doesn’t really bring much idea into mind.\nWhat am I trying to accomplish with the money?\nI want to buy a house. I want to be able to spend money on hobbies. I want to travel. I want to be wealthy enough that I don’t have to constantly restrain myself.\nWhy can’t I do them now?\nBecause it feels like I am killing the goose for a short-term pleasure. It make long-term sense to accumulate a good investment portfolio before spending the returns from the portfolio.\nSo How Large of a Portfolio am I looking at?\nFirst, I need to consider what sort of life do I want to live.\nTravel If I want to travel to Japan for 10 days a year. The flight would probably cost $2000 (random figure). The accommodation around $2000 as well. 3 meals a day, on good meals that I would enjoy, maybe $2000. Spending money on collectibles, maybe $1000. Spending money on transportation and experiences, maybe $3000?\nThat would be about $10,000 across 10 days. All figures are without any basis or research.\n $10,000 per year\n Tennis If possible, I would want to play tennis 3 days a week, 2 hours each. I would also like to have a tennis machine, since I might not be able to find a partner at all times. I would probably have an upfront cost of $5000 for the machine and the balls.\nAssuming I would play for 24 hours per month. And the cost of court booking is $ 20/hour. That would be $ 480/month, or $5760/year for court bookings.\nI would probably need to restring every month playing at that pace. That would bring restring cost to $ 240/year. Assuming I’m using training balls, replaced quarterly, that would be about $ 400/year. Across the year, there would be about 156 tennis session. Assuming 25% of those sessions are games with a two new cans ($ 12 each) of ball each session, that would be about $ 936/year. With 156 tennis sessions each year, I would probably have to cycle through 3 pairs of tennis shoes. That would be at $450/year.\n $7,786 per year\n$5,000 upfront\n House I would also want to have my own house at some point. The house that I want for long-term accommodation, based on current market rate, would be around $ 1,500,000. Given a 20 years loan. 25% down payment. 2% annual interest rate. The upfront cost is $375,000. The monthly repayment is $5,691.19. The renovations and furnishings would probably cost $ 150,000. (another random number)\nCalculations done with this spreadsheet\n $68,294.28 per year\n$525,000 upfront\n For now, these are the biggest expenses that I can think of, that I would want in my “ideal” life. The house is the lowest priority. In other words, I think I am saying that if I can achieve the first two things on my list, I would be “living” my ideal life.\nTo live ideal lifestyle, I would need to be able to spend $17,786 per year. That would be about 35% of my current income.\nIf I want to sustain this lifestyle from the returns on my portfolio, I would need to wait until 2030, assuming 8% ROI, 85% contribution, 3% pay raise, to live this lifestyle.\nIf I reduce my investments allocation from 85% to 50%, I can actually live this lifestyle right now. In doing so, I would need additional 6 years to sustain this lifestyle with my investments.\nThe impact of doing so is that it would take longer for me to get my house, which is already lower in priority. How much longer?\nAt 85% allocation to investments, I would be able to repay the annual loan value with my investments from 2048. But by then, I wouldn’t qualify for a 20 years loan.\nThat means I wouldn’t be able to live in a 1.5m house. If I reduce the value of the house to $ 600,000. The upfront down payment would be $ 150,000 and the monthly loan repayment would be $ 2,276.48 ($ 27,317.76/year).\nAt 85% allocation, I would be able to pay for the house with my investments in 2035. Maybe just barely reaching the cut off point for 20 years loan.\nConclusion I think I have a rough overview of the situation. If I just live with my parents forever, I don’t have to buy a house, and can sustain my ideal lifestyle immediately. And sustain it indefinitely by 2035.\nIf I want to buy a house, I would need to hold off my desired lifestyle until 2041. By then, I would be able to sustain the house loan repayment and my desired lifestyle indefinitely. Although by then, my desired lifestyle would probably have changed.\nAlso, the calculations are over simplified. So this is more like a rough gauge of things. But the thought of working my life off until 2035 or 2041 before I can enjoy life. This doesn’t sounds like living at all. By then I would be about half dead!\nWhich means my intuition is right, I do need to prioritize wealth and increase my earning power. The question is, by how much?\nAssuming that I start a side hustle and it matches my salary in 2025 (4 year plan), the milestone years will be 2027 (vs 2035) or 2034 (vs 2041). Putting me 7-8 years ahead of schedule. Assuming I keep working on my side hustle and job.\nMy daily schedule for the next 4 years will probably be intense. The more I think about it, the more I feel that I’ve started too late. But it will only get later if I don’t start now.\n","permalink":"https://leslietang.com/posts/why-do-i-put-wealth-as-one-of-my-priority/","summary":"I’ve noticed, for a long time, the common denominator that I use to make almost all my decision, is money.\nThis is too expensive, I don’t think it make sense to buy it.\nWhy am I wasting time on things that have no returns?\nHow can I make money with this large purchase that I wanted?\nThe above are some of the common questions that I used to stop myself from spending money.","title":"# Why do I put wealth as one of my priority?"},{"content":"ikigai. a concept that I’ve heard of, but never truly looked into.

Likewise, it is likely to be different 20 years from now.\nWhat you can be paid for 20 years ago, might become a commodity today. Likewise, what you are paid for today, might also become a commodity in 20 years.\nAnd the thing that trouble me the most. What you are good at, and what you love.\nThis troubles me, simply because I do not really have a “passion”. I might have many interests, and might be curious about many things. But there isn’t really anything that I can say that I’m 100% passionate about.\nLikewise, what I am good at is constantly changing. When I was working as an Analyst, my strengths lies in with data processing, analysis, data visualization, making data dashboard, data story telling and things like that.\nAfter pivoting into software, my data related skillsets have rusted and my greater strengths lies in technical design, building tools, requirements analysis and software quality assurance.\nIf everything is constantly changing, are we chasing a phantom? The Venn diagram that illustrates the concept of ikigai, is a useful piece. But I think, it is incomplete. And what we need to be wary of, is applying an incomplete filter to the way we process new information.\nI have no evidence of this. So I am merely guessing.\nThat there would be people who look at that diagram, follow some articles online, and start listing down all the things they can think of about for each of the parts in ikigai.\nThe question is, would they settle on one thing and decide that it is their ikigai? Or would they try to settle on that one thing. Realize this isn’t really what they want. Give up. And form the conclusion that I am a failure.

Something that will help me organize my readings and content consumption. In a manner that will allow me to create new content, based on what I’ve consumed.\nIt sounds like a great idea, to create a loop of consuming and creating content.\nWhile researching, the first thing that I discovered is the “Slip Box”. Commonly referred to as Zettelkasten.\nThe core idea is to accumulate atomic notes. Review them. And draw relations between the notes.\nHow does this looks like in practice?\n1.

Refactoring Our Notes My notes would usually have multiple versions. The first version of my notes are usually too long-winded. Or they might contain too many concepts in a single note.\nTypically, I would notice this issue during level 2 processing. When I only wanted to reference to one part of my old note. That is when I break apart the original notes into different pieces.\nWhy do I do this?\nFirst, this helps create clarity in my understanding of the concepts.\nSecond, it is actually a habit that I’ve picked up in programming.

By teaching you, they teach many. You amplify them. You have one thing they don’t: a beginner’s mind. You see how this works?\n And I suspect this might become valuable datapoint in the future.

You don’t need anyone’s permission to do them, and that’s why they are very egalitarian. They’re great equalizers of leverage.\n I write in public because I want to build media leverage. I want to build media leverage because I believe it will eventually make me rich.

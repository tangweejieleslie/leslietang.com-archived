      <description>It is easy to pivot into something with clear upsides.
Imagine switching from an Analyst in the public sector into Tech in the private sector.
The upside are obvious.
 Tech is booming You are going into a rapidly growing company You are going into a place where you will work with and learn from some of the best engineers You get a significant salary jump  Best of all, there&amp;rsquo;s not much downsides.</description>

      <description>Lower Risk Lower Stakes Starting small usually means you have lower stakes.
Compare two scenarios.
One person have an idea, immediately hire a team of engineers to build the idea, only to find out that idea doesn&amp;rsquo;t really solve the problem.
Another try out the idea on a smaller scale. Wizards of Oz method. A phony application that is handled by humans on the backend.
Quicker Results, Quicker Feedback Starting small means you have a smaller workload.</description>

      <description>We are all work in progress.
When I write an article, I would title it in the end, after getting all my ideas out. Only then, do we have a better idea of what the article is about. If I write an article with the title in the beginning, it is usually a placeholder just to get my brain working. More often than not, I would end up writing about other concepts that may or may not derive from the initial idea.</description>

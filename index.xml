      <description>So, recently, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve become more critical about what people say and write. About the content that I&amp;rsquo;m consuming.
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean their opinions and claims are invalid. Or rather, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a proper thinking and communication system to help me go through the points being made.
I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if I&amp;rsquo;m interpreting their points wrongly, through my personal filter about the subject matter
Some things that comes into mind to research on includes</description>

      <description>Reference: https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/the-fallacy-fallacy
In most statements, there would be the claim. And there would be the argument.
You&amp;rsquo;ll commit the fallacy fallacy, when you asert that someone&amp;rsquo;s claim is false, because their argument is poor.
We have to recognize, that someone can make a correct claim with poor or incorrect argument, or with other logical fallacies.
Someone can also make a wrong claim with a strong and seemingly correct argument, without any fallacies.</description>

      <description>Pancake Technique. It is a workflow that&amp;rsquo;s useful for large projects with multiple versions and edits.
 Create a &amp;ldquo;Selection Sequence&amp;rdquo;. Basically this sequence contains all the clips, with the respective in and out points set and ready for usage Create a &amp;ldquo;Final Edit Sequence&amp;rdquo;. Show both sequences, one over another, in the timeline panel Drag clips from Selection Sequence down to the Final Edit Sequence  Label used clips with a different color to prevent confusion   If there&amp;rsquo;s revision needed, CREATE A NEW SEQUENCE!</description>

What make games addictive are the denial of rewards. How can we bring this to habits building and life in general?
Battle Royales are addictive due to the denial of rewards. Where you don&amp;rsquo;t always win. Nothing to do with fun.
Addiction Aspect
 playing although not having fun is due to addiction due to dopamine reinforcement circuitory behavior reinforcement  This immediately refutes Atomic Habit&amp;rsquo;s 4 steps framework.</description>

      <description>Second video sequence attempt: https://youtu.be/fcXv1gw3SHU
This time round it took about an hour.
Had remembered the mistake about sequence settings. This time round it&amp;rsquo;s a HD version. But had forgotten to set Codec, which slows down the rendering during edit.
Remember to Set Sequence Rendering Codec Experimented with Transitions. Movement and blur effects. It didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly went as I expected, nonetheless, it&amp;rsquo;s still an attempt. Would need to research more about transitions and adjustment layers.</description>

      <description>My first video sequence attempt, using Adobe Premiere Pro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrUc7GaoAA
Some of the challenges encountered.
1. Finding the appropriate clips The difficulty is finding the right clips that will express the ideas I have in mind.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a mistake on the sequence settings. Somewhere along the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve set the sequence to be 1280x720 instead of 1920x1080. It&amp;rsquo;s too much of a hassle to redo everyone on 1080p so I ended up uploading a 720p video.</description>

      <description>Progression on Web Landscapes should not be seen as Linear.
While new advancements are built on old advancements, the potential for progression is never linear.
It only seems linear after abstraction. After drastic simplification.
In fact, many things are often not linear. But are presented linearly.
Let me define linear in a diagram A -&amp;gt; B -&amp;gt; C
In reality, things would probably look more like A -&amp;gt; B A -&amp;gt; B1 B1 -&amp;gt; C B1 -&amp;gt; C2</description>

      <description>The thing that I often hear about Atomic Habits, is the system that gives you 37x growth in a year.
When I hear about 1% improvements, compounded across the year, I thought it sounded difficult to improve in the samething 1% daily. And I thought 37x growth in one year sounds even more daunting.
The first thing that comes into mind is that this claim is as absurd as those that claim to make X% returns on Y amount, through Forex daily.</description>

      <description>Recently I keep seeing about Web 3.0.
I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it is, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m researching it.
https://internationalbanker.com/technology/what-is-web-3-0-and-why-does-it-matter/
https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/3003/web-30-and-40
https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/cryptos-networked-collaboration-will-drive-web-3-0/
Ok, the more I read, the more confusing it gets.
The definition of Web 3.0 changes depending on when the article is written.
The recent trends that I heard about Web 3.0 are mainly due to blockchain technologies.
Things get confusing when concepts from humanities and social sciences gets in.</description>

      <description>I was reading &amp;ldquo;Writing Tools&amp;rdquo; by Roy Peter Clark, to gain some insights that will help me write better. Tool 24 about working from a plan stood out to me.
Minimum Viable Writing In the book, Roy cited an interesting example. About readings being able to get the story and the gist of the writing, the essential parts of the writing, from the headings and subheadings alone.
In other words, from headings and subheadings, we can quickly determine if the idea presented would be valuable, or not.</description>

      <description>I wrote down the steps from the class by Jordy Vandeput on Skillshare. For me, video edit is a pain, mainly because of the sheer number of actions in the UI.
After going through the first video, I realized there is a logical design decision behind Adobe Premiere Pro. That logical flow becomes obvious, once you understand the general workflow.
General Workflow All video edits start with the bin. The bin contains all the relevant resources.</description>

# Outline 

5 days. 8 hours. incremental changes. lessons learnt.
That's the essence that I want to communicate.


1. Start by learning the bare minimum to make something.
	1. How do you determine the bare minimum?
	2. Open up the application of your choice
	3. Find a video about the general workflow
	4. Try it out
2. For me, my current workflow consist of 
	1. Choose the concept
	2. Get a rough flow for the concept
	3. Choose a music that fits the concept
	4. Import the music
	5. Trim the music into a suitable duration to work with
	6. **Choose your videos**
	7. **Import the videos**
	8. **Trim the videos into clips**
	9. **Create Sequences from those clips**
	10. Add in Sound Effects
	11. Add in adjustment layers
		1. for global adjustments, i.e. apply the same LUT to all clips
		2. apply the same crop effect to all clips
	12. Make further adjustments to the clips
		1. things like scale, position, crop, color, etc
	13. Add in transitions
		1. for video
		2. for audio
	14. **Export**
	15. Upload
3. Layer on new knowledge when you need it.
	1. for example, after editing my first video, I thought about transition.
	2. how do I add transitions into my clips?
	3. I call this Just in time Learning
	4. Cite Margaret Riel (2000), Just in time learning
		1. Twiggs (1994)
4. Upload your videos.
	1. You've spent so much time making it, why not just upload it? 
	2. Even if it looks bad to you, even if you think it is not good enough, upload it.
	3. If you find critics, you'll improve from the feedback
	4. If you find friends, you'll grow from the bonds
5. Watch videos from other creators
6. Re-watch your own videos
7. Reflect, make improvements, take notes, experiment, try it, enjoy the process, have fun!

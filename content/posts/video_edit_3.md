3rd Video Sequence
Spent about 1 hour on this.

Total Time spent playing with Adobe Premiere Pro: about 4 hours.

This time round, I've experimented with the following

1. LUTs

Color look up table. This seems very useful to apply a consistent color and feel across the entire video. Using adjustment layers also make it easy to experiment with different LUTs.

2. Sound Effects

Experimented with Sound Effects too. Was looking around for free sound effects and stumbled upon https://freesound.org.

3. Constraint on Clip lengths

I was trying to set some constraints on the clip length. At least in the beginning. After bringing in the music, I extended some clips to mesh better with the music. Maybe I should work on the music first next time. It's much more difficult to find suitable music than it is to find suitable clips. 

Idea. Maybe I can be more specific about the music BPM and time my edits accordingly. 
e.g. 120 bpm x 29 fps = 3480 frames. Could also consider the melody flow and time my clips according to transition across melodies. Not sure if I'm using the correct terms. I can also time the transition according to the frames and beats/notes. 

# Next Attempt

1. Start with the music
2. Calculate the Beats and Frames
3. Mesh the transition according to changes in the music

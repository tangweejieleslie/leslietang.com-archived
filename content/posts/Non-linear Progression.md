Progression on Web Landscapes should not be seen as Linear.

While new advancements are built on old advancements, the potential for progression is never linear. 

It only seems linear after abstraction. After drastic simplification. 

In fact, many things are often not linear. But are presented linearly.

Let me define linear in a diagram
A -> B -> C

In reality, things would probably look more like
A -> B
A -> B1
B1 -> C
B1 -> C2

2 broad approaches to doing things

1. plan first
2. do and make spontaneous changes according to new information

# Planning for Costly Work
I used to think planning first would be better, cause you would make less mistakes. I now think that depends on your proficiency with the subject matter. 

It also depends on the stakes. If the plan would affect lives of others, then it make sense to have a plan, and have others verify the soundness of the plan. 

# Spontaneous for Unknown Work, and Less Costly Work
But in things like side hustle and experiment where the only stakes are time. It might not make sense to spend too much time planning. 

Furthermore, if it is something you are not proficient with, your planning will always be flawed. In such cases, it might make sense to take the spontaneous route and absorb any new information you come across. All these new experiences will eventually help you formulate a plan. A plan which will optimize the process. 

Another consideration we should have, is the time cost for change, or pivot. Let's say you take the spontaneous route. How expensive would it be to change your mind and do something else, relative to continue on with minor adjustments?

# Introduction to OKR

Objectives are **stretch goals** that are somewhat reasonable. 
They should inspire, not deflate morale. 

Key Results are **metrics**. When achieved, objectives will be met. 
They are specific. They are measurable. 
They give a sense of progression.
There should be qualitative and quantitative results.

Key Results are also a basis for check-ins.
Weekly. Monthly. Quarterly. As frequently as needed. 

We can assign color code to our Key Results for ease of visualization.

| Color | Target Achieved | Indication |
| --- | --- | ---|
Green | 70-100% | Keep doing what we have been doing|
Yellow | 30-70% | We might need to change our execution |
Red | 0-30% | Drastic changes needed, either to execution or to the Key Result|

The idea of OKR, is to focus on outcome and impact. Rather than tasks. 
Another benefit is that it help us align our focus on the vision. 
It's easy to lose track of why you are doing something when you get stuck in a routine. 


# Objectives for my Writing

What are [my objectives for writing](https://leslietang.com/posts/why-do-i-write/)? 

1. Media Leverage - basically attention, high volume, high traffic
2. Monetization - conversion of attention and value to money
3. Deeper Understanding - this is more convoluted than I thought. What do I want from having a deeper understanding? 

Reframing my initial "goals" into objectives

1. Achieve 1,000,000 unique views across all my articles in 2022
2. Attract 100 paid subscriptions for my writing, each valued at $15/month in 2022

## Re-Thinking "Deeper Understanding"

Deep understanding could lead to:
- more insights
- creative approach
- unorthodox approach to problems
- a different path to a desirable end state

TODO: I would need better clarity on deeper understanding. 

Braindump
- deeper understanding comes from additional layers of processing, that's the core idea I have in mind, specifically it's the Bloom's Taxonomy that I have in mind
- another concept that I have in mind with deeper understanding is related to Zettelkasten, more specifically, the process of synthesizing new writings from existing atomic notes
- with these in mind, what would be a tangible objective that I can achieve with deeper knowledge? 
  - new writings
  - simpler writings
  - writings that contains the essence of the subject
  - writings that is elegant and can immediately be implemented to create results

# Key Results for my Writing

## KR for 1m views
- I would need to write X amount of articles (is article the correct definition? is article the only form of writing?)
- I would need to market my writings
- I need to write something that at least 1 million people would be interested in
- I need to write in a platform where at least 1 million people can see my works
- I would need X amount of thank you comments on my articles (assuming thank you = quality/potential impact)
- I would need X amount of "Hate" comments (assuming hate comments )


## KR for 100 paid subscribers
- I would need a value proposition worth $15/month
- I would need a copy to communicate the value proposition
- I would need to be clear about the value delivered to these 100 people
- I need to be trusted to deliver the value
- I would need to build rapport with my potential subscribers

# Reflection from Writing this Piece

# Sequence Settings (WIP)

You can set codecs for sequences. 
Video previews codecs will affect rendering during preview. 

`enter` will render the clip

Sequence Codec
- save as preset
- choose clip, type enter/return, will render it
- choose a lightweight codec for quick rendering and previews during edit


To start with, just choose the resolution and framerate. The properties based on your final output, not the video clips resolutions that you will be using.

You can group sequence / nest and make the edit workflow more manageable

You can check and upscale individual resolutions of the clips.

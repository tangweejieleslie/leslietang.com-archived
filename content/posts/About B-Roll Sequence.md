Immediate Impression

## Movements
- movements, camera movements. I need to film my own videos, or maybe learn more about transitions
- I would also need to add in swish or swoosh transition sound effects
- Choreography. Camera usage. Movement. Physical. 



## Pacing
- speed up
- slow down
- emphasis
- different pacing would give different impact
- pacing could be matched to the transition
- congruence between audio and video pacing


## Ideation
- start with a loose idea
- and then bounce off when you are filiming
-

There are skills that we want to become better at. 

Be it coding, content creation or tennis. 

In 4 Hour Chef, Tim Ferriss offers a simple framework to help us approach mastery of skills. 

# Deconstruction

Breaking the skills into smaller components, and keep breaking them down until you are unable to go further. There, you will find the atomic skills. 

I call this the skill graph. 

Video is a subset of communication media.
Video are made up of scenes. 
Scenes are made up of
- Voiceover
- Clips
- Music
- Sound Effects
- Transitions

Voiceover alone would just be a podcast.
Clips alone would just be a GIF.
Music and Sond Effects are self explanatory. 
Transitions could be the transition between scenes or transition between clips, or music, or sound. 

So to summarize, the act of making a video, is to communicate a concept, or an idea, through the combination of narration, clips, enhanced through musics and sound effects and signposted through transitions. 

The question is, do you need to make all of them yourselves? Do you need to produce your own music? Sound effects? Clips? Not necessary. 

The main purpose of a video, is to communicate. 

It could be an idea. A message. A concept. A value. 

So the most important skill, would be to find and put together something coherent that will bring the message across to the viewer. 


# Selection
Identify the major skills. In the example of making videos, I think the most important thing would be: 

> Putting together something coherent from voice, clips, music, sound effect, transitions that will convey a message to viewers.

**Putting together** the parts. Not **producing** the parts. Producing is only necessary when the available parts are inadequate. 

And the precondition is to have a message. 

So how do you craft a message? 

Let's deconstruct this even further.

What is a message?

- it could be an idea, a concept, a single point of information.
- it could also be made up of them


Let's rephrase this. What is the point of messages? Why do people search for them? Why do people consume them? 

If the Book "4 Hour Chef" is a "message", why did I "consume" it?

Because I want to learn. Because I want a structure, a framework, a way to help me learn better, make progress

That means, a message should provide value. 

And the value it provide, could be in the form of 
1. a practical solution
2. a new idea (an idea people don't yet know about)
3. a new way of applying existing idea
4. a framework
5. a structure
6. a step by step guide
7. a compilation of most important principles (pareto)
8. a way for people to do less and get more
9. a way to solve a problem
10. entertainment, fun, interesting

Attempting to categorize them, the value a message provides could be
1. Solves a Problem
2. Removes an obstacle (Thinking / Confusion / Uncertainty)
	1. Obstacle towards taking action?
3. Entertainment
4. Present a complicated topic in a digestable manner (makes people feel smarter)


# Sequencing

So I have a loose set of skills that could a

There could potentiall be thousands of reasons that will cause me to fail

- big corporations
- stronger competitions
- corporations with huge investment funds


But the strength given to all start ups and small players. Are the strength of speed and flexibility. 
We do not have the fear of losing our existing base or our existing schema, culture, whatever. Because we begin with nothing.

Move fast. We can definitely move faster than giant corporations. The difficulty is moving faster than other start ups. 

The next question, is this a competition or collaboration? I believe it should be the second. 

Think of ways to collaborate with other start ups. Ultimately, the goal is to bring value to people. Imagine if two different start ups who enter the market, targeting the same market, ended up collaborating. 

- consumers would get benefit from both sides
- the two start ups would merge into a bigger corporation
- eventually, the mergers with one another will turn it into a giant monopoly


# Conclusion
Just find a single reason that you can achieve success and cling to it. 

In a tree with a 1000 nodes, even if 999 are failures, you'll just need to find that single node.

# Lower Risk Lower Stakes
Starting small usually means you have lower stakes. 

**Compare two scenarios.**

One person have an idea, immediately hire a team of engineers to build the idea, only to find out that idea doesn't really solve the problem.

Another try out the idea on a smaller scale. Wizards of Oz method. A phony application that is handled by humans on the backend. 



# Quicker Results, Quicker Feedback
Starting small means you have a smaller workload. You can get small results quickly and useful feedback quickly. 

# Examples in Software Development
Idea -> Mock Up -> MVP -> Feedback -> Iterate


# Validation
Validate your idea
Validate your feelings
Validate your expectations

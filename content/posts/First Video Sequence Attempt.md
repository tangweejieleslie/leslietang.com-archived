My first video sequence attempt, using Adobe Premiere Pro.

Some of the challenges encountered.

# 1. Finding the appropriate clips
The difficulty is finding the right clips that will express the ideas I have in mind. 

I've also made a mistake on the sequence settings. Somewhere along the process, I've set the sequence to be 1280x720 instead of 1920x1080. It's too much of a hassle to redo everyone on 1080p so I ended up uploading a 720p video.

# 2. Finding suitable music
I wonder if there's any libraries or tools that will give you the music that you have in mind. 

It's extremely difficult to describe music, especially for someone like me with no music background. 

Editing the transition to the beat is even more challenging. I gave up on editing to beat. 

Instead, I've added audio effects at the point of transition. I think once I learn more about the different effects, this might be a useful trick. 

# 3. Transition between clips
I didn't apply any transition this time round. I think I rather have it jump between scenes than having a weird transition. Another thing that I need to pick up.

It took me about 2 hours just to get this 14 seconds sequence out. 
Newfound respect to YouTube content creators. Especially those who does their own edits.

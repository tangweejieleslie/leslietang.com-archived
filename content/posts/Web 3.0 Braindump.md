Recently I keep seeing about Web 3.0.

I don't know what it is, that's why I'm researching it.

Ok, the more I read, the more confusing it gets. 

The definition of Web 3.0 changes depending on **when** the article is written.

The recent trends that I heard about Web 3.0 are mainly due to blockchain technologies. 

Things get confusing when concepts from humanities and social sciences gets in. 

Rather than the term Web 3.0 and 2.0, it would make more sense to put it as before and after blockchain mass adoption. 

If I were to loosely craft a timeline, about how web technologies impacted my life, it would be as follow

1. Domain Names. This is my first memory of interaction with the internet. We visit websites by going straight to the domain names. I remember entering random domain names to see where they will bring me. I remember seeing domain names on television and posters. This is the era where we still lived mainly in the physical world. 
2. Search Engines. This is when we are able to discover new websites easily. 
3. Blogs. This is the era where we would put links to our friends blogs. Where we would share updates of our lives, mainly through text. There's no smart phones. So it's difficult to have access to pictures. 
4. Social Media. This is when we started sharing a portion of ourselves online. And seeing a curated snippets of other people's lives.  The social network that I used are those that my friends are using. Started off with Friendster and Hi5, and then ended with Facebook. We would scan our year book onto the computer and use those as our profile pictures. Or we would befriend people who have access to camera and ask them for a custom photo.
5. Web Gaming. Social Media Gaming.
6. Smart Phones.
7. Mobile Gaming. 
8. Photo Sharing. Everyone with a smartphone can easily take pictures and share them. 
9. Videos Sharing and Streaming. People can also take videos and share them easily. 
10. Live Streaming. As network improves, live streaming becomes a reality. 
11. Online Purchases (this happens earlier, it's just that I wasn't 18 yet, so I didn't have a card for transactions)
12. Blockchain.
13. NFT
14. NFT Gaming


Hmm, is my life simply tied to gaming, or is gaming usually one of the first few use cases of new technology?

Social Media games make it so that people can compete and flaunt their progress. Things like leaderboards is one of the key experience in those games. At least for myself.

Mobile games make it so that you can play anywhere. About the time when I stopped buying new handheld consoles.

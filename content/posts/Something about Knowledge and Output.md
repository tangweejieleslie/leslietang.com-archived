I’m trying to figure out a system, a process. Something that will help me organize my readings and content consumption. In a manner that will allow me to create new content, based on what I’ve consumed.

It sounds like a great idea, to create a loop of consuming and creating content.

While researching, the first thing that I discovered is the “Slip Box”. Commonly referred to as Zettelkasten.

The core idea is to accumulate atomic notes. Review them. And draw relations between the notes.

How does this looks like in practice?

# 1. Taking Quick Notes

While consuming content, **jot down any information that stood out** in a temporary page. This serves as the first draft of your notes.

My quick notes look something like this

It contains a **reference link** to the source material, and **bullet points of things** that seems noteworthy.

Keep all of these quick notes in a **common folder**. And process them before you forget about the content. It is commonly suggested to go through them at the end of the day.

Personally, I try to process them immediately when I have the time.

What exactly does processing entails?

# 2. Processing Your Notes

Processing simply means going through your notes, and make it succinct. And if the opportunity arises, try to find other notes that is related to the new note. This help us build a web of knowledge.

The above is what I called a “Level 1 Processing”. Where I only **work on extracting the key points**, and putting it into proper sentences.

Level 2 Processing, is when we try to **find connections between our notes**.

Below, is a note that I’ve created after reading about Feymann Technique and seeing a connection between Feymann Technique and Zettelkasten.

# 3. Refactoring Our Notes

My notes would usually have multiple versions. The first version of my notes are usually too long-winded. Or they might contain too many concepts in a single note.

Typically, I would notice this issue during level 2 processing. When I only wanted to reference to one part of my old note. That is when I break apart the original notes into different pieces.

**Why do I do this?**

First, this helps **create clarity** in my understanding of the concepts.

Second, it is actually a habit that I’ve picked up in programming. It is a concept of “**Don’t Repeat Yourself**” which I will not cover here.

The above is an example of the refactored version of my notes. Where the main note contain links to smaller pieces of the original note.

# Conclusion

I think creating an article. A podcast. A video. These are the ultimate output that we can derive from the bunch of notes that we accumulate. I think it is inspiring when I read about what Niklas Luhmann has accomplished. And that is partly a reason for me wanting to set up some way to publish content.

Pancake Technique. It is a workflow that's useful for large projects with multiple versions and edits. 
1. Create a "Selection Sequence". Basically this sequence contains all the clips, with the respective in and out points set and ready for usage
2. Create a "Final Edit Sequence".
3. Show both sequences, one over another, in the timeline panel
4. Drag clips from Selection Sequence down to the Final Edit Sequence
	1. Label used clips with a different color to prevent confusion
5. If there's revision needed, CREATE A NEW SEQUENCE!
	1. and then you can duplicate the clips from the first edit to the second edit sequence.

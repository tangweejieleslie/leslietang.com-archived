I recorded 2 video with voiceover recently. I realize I hate my voice. 

I experimented, I realized I like my voice better when I speak faster.

And then I tried speeding up my voice. After the pitch change as an effect of speeding up at 1.3-1.5x, it actually sounded way better. Although it sounded way higher pitched than my normal vocal range. 

Still, it's a fun experiment. 

What are the components of the voice we produce?

1. Pitch
2. Pace
3. Volume


These are the obvious things that I can think of. 

What about music?

1. Rhythm
	1. beat
		1. the atomic component. 
	2. tempo, speed
		1. the speed of the beat. 60 bpm, 120bpm
	3. **meter**: measures, rhythmic groupings, different number of beats, 2-3-4
		1. grouping of beats
2. Melody
	1. Pitch/Note/Tone
		1. individual sound
	2. Scale
		1. pattern of notes
	3. Melodic Contour
		1. shape of melodies
			1. rising
			2. rising flat
			3. rising falling
			4. flat rising
			5. flat
			6. flat falling
			7. falling rising
			8. falling flat
			9. faling

Being monotonous, means I don't have much melody. nor much variation in my tones. 

3. Harmony
	1. relationship of pitches
	2. more than one note (not applicable to speaking, I guess)
4. Timbre
	1. quality of the from pitch, length, intensity
		1. different intruments producing the same tone will sound different
		2. this is due to the quality of the material that produces the sound
		3. I guess, this is my vocal chords, my voice box, a physical quality
			1. I can't change my physical qualities, but I can learn to control it, I think.
5. Dynamics
	1. relating to degree of loudness
		1. very loud
		2. loud
		3. medium loud
		4. medium soft
		5. soft
		6. very soft
		7. gradually loudening
		8. gradually softening
6. Texture
	1. pattern of sound, created by interaction of musical voices
		1. ok, don't think I can do this alone
7. Form
	1. shape of musical composition
	2. defined by new and repeated segment
	3. basically, patterns of sound

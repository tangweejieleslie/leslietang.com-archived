Starting something difficult.
For me, that is starting a YouTube channel. 
Something that I've thought about for so long. 

I think part of the reason why it was so difficult, is because I wanted to start a Successful YouTube channel that can make a side income. Not start a YouTube channel. 

Obviously, the framing is applying a lot of pressure on myself. 

The precondition to a successful channel, is to have a channel. 
The precondition to having a channel, is to create videos consistently.
The precondition creating videos consistently, is the skills to create a video. 
And the breakdown of the skills needed for a video, are

1. idea
2. script
3. recording video
4. recording voice over
5. video edit
6. sound edit
7. sound design
8. music design
9. thumbnail
10. title
11. description
12. putting it all together into a coherent piece

## Script

### Set up
What stopped me from taking the first step? 
I think my biggest obstacle, is that the task is too big. 
It's so big, that it is overwhelming.

### First Resolution

I eventually decided to do the simplest thing. 
Just choose a random video about video edit, and follow along. 
Even if it's just going through the motions, it is fine. 
Just get started.

After going through the motion, I managed to get a loose grasp of the components in the video edit process.

### Abstraction of Process

1. Choosing the Clips
2. Triming the Clips
3. Making a Sequence from those Clips

This is the bare minimum process in making a video. It will be pretty basics, but it is a video.

So that's my first experiment, try to make a video using these 3 steps. 

I've went back to the tutorial and took notes of the steps, the process, where the different buttons are on the editting tool, what the shortcuts are, make a cheat sheet, and start on my first experiment.

It took 2 hours. From creating the new Adobe Premiere Pro Project to exporting. The whole process took 2 hours. 

### Self Reflection
After creating my first video. Or rather, just a simple sequence. Now I have a reference point. I have something that I can analyse and critique. I have something that I can reflect on. And that's what I did. 

I've only realized my first video was in 720p after uploading it on YouTube. Turns out I didn't set the correct settings! It's a minor thing. 

I didn't learn it from the tutorial. I'm guessing it's something that seasoned creators do habitually. 

You won't learn the intricacies from watching. You'll learn them from doing and experiencing. 

Apart from the technical aspect, there's also the creative aspect. How does the sequence felt? How does the clips flow? How is the end product? This part is subjective. 

My first idea is to add transition. The abrupt cut from one clip to another felt weird. My second idea is to pay more attention to the music. I choose a music without much thought and it just felt off. 

### Extending the Process

In my next video, I experimented with transitions. It looked fine when editing, but re-watching it after publishing, I felt that adding the transition reduce the quality of the end product.

At least now I learn about transitions and experimented with it. I also learnt that you should render the video before previewing. 

### Repeat. 

Go through the iterations.
I've started with a 3 step process. 
Then I reflected on my output. 
Find ways to improve the product. 
Refine the process. 
Remember the mistakes.


### Habit Loop
Trigger
Action
Reward

Right now, the reward is the growth. Getting better and better at each try. This is the greatest feeling for me now. 

The trigger, is looking at my previous reflection. My reflection at the end of each cycle list down key action points. I simply act on those action points. This might be a problem. If I can't think of anything specific to improve, then my trigger would be lost. 

It could be improvement, or it could be extension into another idea.

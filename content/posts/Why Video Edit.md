Set Up. Why did I start learning about video editing?

1. Seems fun
2. It's a core skill that would be useful for a YouTube channel
3. I want to start a channel for the side income potential
4. Video edit is the core part, which seems so daunting and difficult, so I wanted to try something low stakes and fun. Just to get a taste. 


At the core of things, I just want to make money through side hustle, that is decoupled from my time. i.e. paid for my output, not my time. 

How did I reach this conclusion?

I realized if I stayed on this path, I will have to give up a lot of my life. Or rather, a lot of my time. 
This path of being a good employee. Climbing the corporate ladder. Serving the company. 
Even if the pay is good. Even if I'm learning. Even if I'm gaining experience. Is it worth it? Ultimately, do I want to keep climbing to the top of the coporate ladder, or do I want to build my own path in life? 

I want my own path.

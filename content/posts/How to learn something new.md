Context
I want to learn video edit. I want to start a YouTube channel. For so long. 
Something is stopping me. Fear. 

What am I afraid of? Failure. 

How do I overcome it?

1. create an anonymous youtube channel.


What is daunting?

Video edit. Filming. Script. Screenplay. Ideas.

To make a video, there's a ton of stuffs that you need to do. If you jump straight it, you'll just get overwhelmed.

Break down the difficult end product, that is filled with multiple complex steps. into smaller chunks.

What goes into a video?

1. The clips
2. Audio
	1. music
	2. sound effects
	3. voiceover
3. Images
4. Transitions

What are the steps you need to take?
1. Plan the video
2. Plan the script
4. Film the video
5. record additional voiceover
6. Bring the content into your computer
7. Video Edit
8. Thumbnail
9. Title
10. Description
11. Marketing


Basically, there are a lot of stuffs that you'll need to do!

Did you notice this? Saying that you want to try YouTube, means saying you want to do at least all of the above? There's way more than trying your hands at something! 

I think, the trick is, to break things down into manageable chunks. 

Another way, is to make it fun. By looking forward to it. I think. Maybe. At least I ended up enjoying the things and looking forward to it...

1. Deconstruct the Skill. Hey, I'm doing that already
2. Self-correct. Hey, I'm doing that too. Although, I'm just using my instincts, on self-reflection.
	1. Although I guess I did watch a ton of videos, so I do have a rough sense of what seems good and what seems bad.
3. Remove Practice Barriers. I think the alternative, is to create a desire magnet. For me, it just gotten so fun and interesting to try new stuff, that I don't find much barriers to the learning and doing.
4. Practice at least 20 hours. This is interesting. I'm on my 6th hour. 14 more. It's going to be interesting to see how far I can go

In most statements, there would be the claim. And there would be the argument. 

You'll commit the fallacy fallacy, when you asert that someone's claim is false, because their argument is poor. 

We have to recognize, that someone can make a correct claim with poor or incorrect argument, or with other logical fallacies. 

Someone can also make a wrong claim with a strong and seemingly correct argument, without any fallacies.

| Claim | Argument | |
|---|---|---|
|True | Good | Ideal Scenario |
| True | Bad | Don't Dismiss the claim! |
| False | Good | Beware of being suckered |
| False | Bad | umm...|

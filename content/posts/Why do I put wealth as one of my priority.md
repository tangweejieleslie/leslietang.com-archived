I’ve noticed, for a long time, the common denominator that I use to make almost all my decision, is money.

This is too expensive, I don’t think it make sense to buy it.

Why am I wasting time on things that have no returns?

How can I make money with this large purchase that I wanted?

The above are some of the common questions that I used to stop myself from spending money. It works well in helping me save and invest.

And after reaching the limits of saving and investment. The new question that pops up in my mind, is how can I make more?

This article, serves as a self-reflection. A “Thinking in Public” type of article.

**Why the obsession with money?** This is what I want to find out, but simply asking this doesn’t really bring much idea into mind.

**What am I trying to accomplish with the money?**

I want to buy a house. I want to be able to spend money on hobbies. I want to travel. I want to be wealthy enough that I don’t have to constantly restrain myself.

**Why can’t I do them now?**

Because it feels like I am killing the goose for a short-term pleasure. It make long-term sense to accumulate a good investment portfolio before spending the returns from the portfolio.

**So How Large of a Portfolio am I looking at?**

First, I need to consider what sort of life do I want to live.

### Travel

If I want to travel to Japan for 10 days a year. The flight would probably cost $2000 (random figure). The accommodation around $2000 as well. 3 meals a day, on good meals that I would enjoy, maybe $2000. Spending money on collectibles, maybe $1000. Spending money on transportation and experiences, maybe $3000?

That would be about $10,000 across 10 days. All figures are without any basis or research.

> $10,000 per year

### Tennis

If possible, I would want to play tennis 3 days a week, 2 hours each. I would also like to have a tennis machine, since I might not be able to find a partner at all times. I would probably have an upfront cost of _**$5000**_ for the machine and the balls.

Assuming I would play for 24 hours per month. And the cost of court booking is $ 20/hour. That would be $ 480/month, or **$5760/year** for court bookings.

I would probably need to restring every month playing at that pace. That would bring restring cost to **$ 240/year**. Assuming I’m using training balls, replaced quarterly, that would be about **$ 400/year**. Across the year, there would be about 156 tennis session. Assuming 25% of those sessions are games with a two new cans ($ 12 each) of ball each session, that would be about **$ 936/year.** With 156 tennis sessions each year, I would probably have to cycle through 3 pairs of tennis shoes. That would be at **$450/year**.

> $7,786 per year
> 
> $5,000 upfront

## House

I would also want to have my own house at some point. The house that I want for long-term accommodation, based on current market rate, would be around $ 1,500,000. Given a 20 years loan. 25% down payment. 2% annual interest rate. The upfront cost is _**$375,000**_. The monthly repayment is $5,691.19. The renovations and furnishings would probably cost $ 150,000. (another random number)

_[Calculations done with this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ay-6UKUWPLKaTs2S-Pq4abvu-oSjWG164peBoOuZG1E/edit#gid=1747276494)_

> $68,294.28 per year
> 
> $525,000 upfront

For now, these are the biggest expenses that I can think of, that I would want in my “ideal” life. The house is the lowest priority. In other words, I think I am saying that if I can achieve the first two things on my list, I would be “living” my ideal life.

To live ideal lifestyle, I would need to be able to spend **$17,786 per year**. That would be about 35% of my current income.

If I want to sustain this lifestyle from the returns on my portfolio, I would need to wait until 2030, assuming 8% ROI, 85% contribution, 3% pay raise, to live this lifestyle.

If I reduce my investments allocation from 85% to 50%, I can actually live this lifestyle right now. In doing so, I would need additional 6 years to sustain this lifestyle with my investments.

The impact of doing so is that it would take longer for me to get my house, which is already lower in priority. How much longer?

At 85% allocation to investments, I would be able to repay the annual loan value with my investments from 2048. But by then, I wouldn’t qualify for a 20 years loan.

That means I wouldn’t be able to live in a 1.5m house. If I reduce the value of the house to $ 600,000. The upfront down payment would be $ 150,000 and the monthly loan repayment would be $ 2,276.48 (**$ 27,317.76/year**).

At 85% allocation, I would be able to pay for the house with my investments in 2035. Maybe just barely reaching the cut off point for 20 years loan.

# Conclusion

I think I have a rough overview of the situation. If I just live with my parents forever, I don’t have to buy a house, and can sustain my ideal lifestyle immediately. And sustain it indefinitely by 2035.

If I want to buy a house, I would need to hold off my desired lifestyle until 2041. By then, I would be able to sustain the house loan repayment and my desired lifestyle indefinitely. Although by then, my desired lifestyle would probably have changed.

Also, the calculations are over simplified. So this is more like a rough gauge of things. But the thought of working my life off until 2035 or 2041 before I can enjoy life. This doesn’t sounds like living at all. By then I would be about half dead!

Which means my intuition is right, I do need to prioritize wealth and increase my earning power. The question is, by how much?

Assuming that I start a side hustle and it matches my salary in 2025 (4 year plan), the milestone years will be 2027 (vs 2035) or 2034 (vs 2041). Putting me 7-8 years ahead of schedule. Assuming I keep working on my side hustle and job.

My daily schedule for the next 4 years will probably be intense. The more I think about it, the more I feel that I’ve started too late. But it will only get later if I don’t start now.

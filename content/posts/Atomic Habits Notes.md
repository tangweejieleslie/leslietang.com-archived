The thing that I often hear about Atomic Habits, is the system that gives you 37x growth in a year. 

When I hear about 1% improvements, compounded across the year, I thought it sounded difficult to improve in the samething 1% daily. And I thought 37x growth in one year sounds even more daunting. 

The first thing that comes into mind is that this claim is as absurd as those that claim to make `X`% returns on `Y` amount, through Forex daily. They are essentially implying everyone will become million and billionaires in 1 year, depending on `X` and `Y`. 

The numbers make sense. The logic seems to make sense. But does the whole thing make sense? 

One thing that stood out is the "Law of Marginal Aggregation". I think this is the thing that gets misused. As a magical system that gives everyone 37x gains in a year with small effort.

|2020|21|3483|87H 20' 05''|1| |

I look up the stats to convince myself that Team Sky is indeed doing something right. The results shows true. You need to be doing something right to get 1st place 5/9 times. This gives credibility to the Law of Marginal Aggregation. 

# How do we apply Law of Marginal Aggregation?
First, identify all possible actions that could potentially be related to the desired outcome. 

A mind map sounds like the most intuitive way to do this.

We can start by thinking about the obvious things. To win a cycling race, what the the obvious components?
The cyclist and the bicycle. And then we can think of the different components that makes up each of them, and the potential components that would affect the end result. 

And as you branch out into the various components and factors, you'll eventually reach a point where you can no longer fan out further. i.e. you have arrived at all the atomic parts of the system. 

# Strategy to Build The Habits

1. Build a new Identity
2. Build a new Belief System
3. Strengthen them with new Evidences
4. Gain New Evidence by Tracking your Actions

When I think about Identity, the first thing that pops into mind is the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. 

**How does most of these indicator works? **

You answer a questionaire about yourself. You answer them based on what you think is the most correct answer. 

**How did you make the choice about those answers?** 

By referring to your memory of specific events and your actions, and thoughts, in those specific events. 

**Question.** Are these our "Natural Tendencies", or are these our "Comfortable Tendencies"?  Or maybe, are these our "Most Frequent/Common/Memorable Tendencies?"

# Personal Action Plan
## 1. Goals Setting
I will still start from goals. Goals are there as a guiding point, towards some concrete direction. Become healthier for the sake of health doesn't evoke much emotions, neither is it inspiring. Become healthier because I want to live longer and be with my family for as long as humanly possible is much more inspiring.

## 2. Factors Brainstorm
Of course, we do not stop at goals setting. Next step, would be to think about the different components and factors that will relate to the goal. For example, health naturally is a result of what you eat and what you do with your body. The obvious components (maybe direct) are "Nutrition" and "Exercise". Not so obvious components (indirect) could be sleep, environment, amount of sunlight. 

## 3. Identity Identification
Then, I should identify existing beliefs about myself and what are the evidences that forms my beliefs about that identity. And whether these identities and beliefs are in conflict with my goals. Whether if there's any obvious alignment between the factors with my existing beliefs. 

If there's alignment, the change should come easy. Else, I would need to work on building new identities.

## 4. Gathering Evidences
The easiest form of gathering evidence, is to further breakdown the identity into smaller components. Alongside the existing evidences you have. To break your existing identity, you simply need to offer counter evidences. 

If you belief yourself to be fat, and that is supported by evidence of desire for sweet food. A simple counter example is to throw away the sweet food you have. Or to give them away. 

Throwing them away reinforce the idea that you think sweet food are trash. Giving them away reinforce the idea that you value your friends more than your sweet tooth, maybe. 

Each time you create a new counter evidence, record it. This serve as a tangible evidence that is way stronger than your memory about old evidences.

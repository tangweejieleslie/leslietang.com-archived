I recorded 2 video with voiceover recently. I realize I hate my voice. 

I experimented, I realized I like my voice better when I speak faster.

And then I tried speeding up my voice. After the pitch change as an effect of speeding up at 1.3-1.5x, it actually sounded way better. Although it sounded way higher pitched than my normal vocal range. 

Still, it's a fun experiment.

Brainstorm "I am " sentence.

I am thinking **about my life** (birthday cake) -> I've been thinking
Thinking implies not doing, implies not living


- the other side of the same coin
- same thing, said from another end
- I never take -> I always give
- I've been really thinking -> I've not been really living

What's the deeper truth of that? 
- about not really been living
- got to be an I statement
- deeper truth is about you
	- "I haven't been going out"
- Don't think about the pandemic, that's the birthday cake. the specifics are the birthday cakes. Anecdotes
- I'm confused
- I've found out 
- I was told XXX
- My life wasn't what it really was
- Don't ask questions. Make a statement
- I'm not who I thought I was



Make Statements. Make I Statements. 

I don't know who I really am.
I'm stuck.

Wof. https://youtu.be/V7yTb-k1ju4?t=350 

It's similar to the 5 Whys. 

Deeper truth. felt it before you said it. 

Can you hold onto that emotions that you've felt, and start telling a story from that place. 

And from there, write down all the details.

Plot vs sequences vs characters. 

audience need to first, care about the characters. only then, will they care about the plot. 

The character will lead you to the rest of the stuffs. 

# Character comes from the voice

Voice, deep voice is compelling

Voice -> Character -> Plot

the character needs to be relatable, through the authentic, intimate voice. 

# How to build and develop characters?

1. Establishing the voice
2. How do they talk
3. How they see the world
4. Their attitude towards the world

Character checklist. For ALL characters. 

- make a note of all the things you found interesting. 
	- when watching
	- when inspired
	- when reading
	- little things


Little things to illustrate the character
- how do they eat their eggs
- 3 points
	- fridge
	- books
		- what people are reading
		- all the books about one subject, and one random book, anomalies
		- 
	- medical cabinet
		- cream, haven't used in a year
		- kept it, because who knows, the rash may come back
	
	
The devil is in the details!

Biggest wound. 

Biggest embarrassment. 

The shows that you've enjoyed. Audience will be like, I'm in pain, so are you. 

1. I'm not that bad
2. I'm the same! It's a story about me!

Writers don't need an outline

We don't know where we are going to go! Writing is a process, an impulse, about working the concepts. It is NOT ABOUT GOING TOWARDS AN END PRODUCT!

Go through the process and let the results take care of itself.

NEVER, START WITH AN OUTLINE.

Except, when you are being paid for the story, and there's a deadline soon. 

You are better off if you don't know where you are going in the story.

After watching my video with fresh eyes. I can say with conviction that this is trash. 

I would click away without thoughts. 

What do I need to improve? 

A clearer message. A more compelling reason for viewers to watch. The hook. 

# What is the value proposition of this video?
There are 3 main points in the video. 

1. Reframing a difficult task
	1. Alternative Phrasing
		1. Expect nothing
		2. Don't expect anything
		3. Don't expect results immediately
		4. Reframe into long term perspective
		5. Be realistic but hold the unrealistic dream close to your heart
2. Simplify the process 
3. Reflect and iterate


# Credibility

These 3 steps, when they come together, should enable someone to start difficult things. This is my assumption. I'm a nobody. There's no credibility to my words. Are the external sources that I can bring in? 


# Emphasis on Self

It's a self reflection, I get it. But people care about themselves more than they care about you! 


# Actions to Improve

1. Re-write the script. Place the emphasis on the benefits it brings to the viewers. Be clear about it. Be concise. 
2. My voice. Sounds terrible. Will require time to improve, but do something about it!
3. Edit. Should I just do a talking head video?

## Reference Material

For now, I found this book in the library. Let's go through this and use it as a starting point.

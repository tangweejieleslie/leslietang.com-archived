I am already writing in private - notes, scraps, etc. My private writing style only make sense to me, by improving my writing, I would be improving my understanding.

I chance upon two articles - 

- ***"Learning in Public"*** by swyx https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public
>  At some point people will start asking you for help because of all the stuff you put out. 80% of developers are “dark”, they dont write or speak or participate in public tech discourse. But you do. You must be an expert, right? Don’t tell them you aren’t. Answer best as you can, and when you’re stuck or wrong pass it up to your mentors.

- ***"How to Get Rich"*** by Naval https://nav.al/rich
> Coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, YouTubing, these kinds of things, these are permissionless. You don’t need anyone’s permission to do them, and that’s why they are very egalitarian. They’re great equalizers of leverage.


I write in public because I want to build ***media leverage***. I want to build media leverage because I believe it will eventually make me rich. Even if it fails to make me ***rich***, it would have forced me to organize my thoughts and ***deepen my understanding*** on the things that I'm writing. Writing in public might create more accountability. This might make me more consistent than simply writing in private.


### What I want to achieve from writing in public

1. Media Leverage - articles that creates value, and is consumed by many
2. Monetization - as long as value is created, there would be opportunity for riches to be created
3. Deeper Understanding - I would deepen my knowledge through additional processing for public consumption

--- 

### Future Add-ons

1. Metrics to track the above objectives
2. Systems to make it consistent - Atomic Habits, James Clear
3. Rules for "Bare Minimum Content" so that my habit streak will not break

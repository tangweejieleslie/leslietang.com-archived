The beliefs I have about writing.

- Writing should be done with a target audience in mind
- Writing should be structured
- Writing should create value

A poorly structured writing without a target audience in mind would be messy. And messy writing does not create value. That's why I should not write.

The paradox is that I will never know which writings are valuable until I created them. Value is only assessable in hindsight. 

As a marketing plan to create media leverage, I would guess that my current writings will never make it. 

That's fine. 

For now, I should just write for myself. To organize my thought. To improve my writing skills. To think about hypothetical target audience that would find value in my work, and re-work the drafts to fit the audience later.

Quoting [sywx](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/), my current value proposition is a beginner's mind. 

> Because you learn in public. By teaching you, they teach many. You amplify them. You have one thing they don’t: a beginner’s mind. You see how this works? 

And I suspect this might become valuable datapoint in the future. For example, someone who wants to go on this same path as me would have a map perfectly laid out.

### Future Add-ons

1. Be more explicit with my thoughts - for example, the why, the planning, the iterations, the drafts - each versions are accessible through github, so that part is set
   1. because the why, the aim, the objective of the post, where do I see this post heading, etc, would all be valuable context

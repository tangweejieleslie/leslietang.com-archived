Learn from the top 5% that started from nothing, and reach there in record time. And model them. 

Example. The story of Shinji Takeuchi vs Michael Pelps 

Material Beats Methods. For learning language, focus on the high frequency words. 

Principle of Transfer. Find a place where learning are interesting. The act becomes fun. Practice the foundation there. The foundational skills will then be transferrable into other areas. 

# 2 Litmus Test
Is the method effective? -> find the high frequency, high value stuffs to focus your learning on
Is the method sustainable? -> choose a schedule, and subject matter, that you can and will stick with. 

The above two ensures effectiveness. Next is about efficiency.
Tim defines effectiveness as "doing the right things" and efficiency as "doing things right"


# The formula
Deconstruction: find the minimal learnable units. This is pretty much like doing QA, breakdown the thing into the smallest components. 

- best thought of as exploration
- throw things on wall, see what sticks


- **Reducing**. 
	- breakdown the skill. group them into categories. learn the most important categories. (data analytics)
- **Interviewing**. 
	- find a list of top performers in the field
	- provide context. let them know the benefit to them
	- ask questions.
		- who is good at X, despite being poorly build for it?
		- who are the most controversial/unorthodox? why? what do you think of them?
		- who are the most impressive, lesser-known teachers?
		- What makes you different? who trained/influenced you?
		- have you trained others to do this? have they replicated your results?
		- what are the biggest mistakes and myths you see in X training?
		- what are your favourite books/resources on X? if people had to teach themselves, what would you suggest they use?
		- if you were to train me for 4 weeks for a competition and had a million dollars on the line, what would the training look like? what if I had 8 weeks?
- **Reversal**. 
	- sometimes. not everytime. sometimes, the path of least resistance is as easy as Googling "backwards, upside-down, reverse" + skill that you are deconstructing
- Translating.
	- for language....


**Selection**: which 20% of the blocks should I focus on for more than 80% of the outcome? This is also like QA process, of prioritization.

- 

Sequencing: in what order should I learn the blocks. this is also like QA. there are components that will block other components. focus on the potential blockers first, else you'll just end up with a bunch of failing tickets with no progress. 

- **logical sequence**. the order you learn something can make all the difference
- system. clear progression. two key elements.
- start with the end game. the end result. backwards. 
	- don't just start with the foundations. start with the desired end results. the single node out of the entire tree.
	- 



Stakes: how do I set up stakes, create real consequences, and guarantee that I follow the program?

## Secondary Principles

Compression: can I encapsulate the most important 20% into an easily graspable one-pager?

- cheat sheets for anything
- prescriptive one pager:
	- list principles that help you generate real world examples
	- i.e. the rules
- practice one-pager
	- list real world examples to practice
	- that indirectly teaches those principles

Frequency: how frequently should I practice? Can I cram? What will my schedule looks like? What is the minimum effective dose for volume? 

- little details, big results
- the small things will affect the big things. butterfly effect. trickle down. complex systems often behave like this, I think.

For longer terms.

For a 28 days allocation

Days
1. 3.5: Sugar high
2. 7: Dip and rise
3. 10.5 Plateau
4. 21: inflexion point
5. 28: fluency

5-10 minutes break across two session of 45 minutes outperforms a single session of 90 minutes

Von Restorff Effect


Encoding: how do I anchor the new material to what I already know for rapid recall? example, Acronyms. 

- about making slippery ideas stick
- basically a bunch of stuffs about memory tricks
	- for numbers
	- for words
	- for ideas
	- method of loci and numbers encoding system

About public speaking

60 minutes: approximately 30 presentation, 30 Q&A
2 min intro
10 + 10 + 10
2 min close

3 main takeaways / actions

For each, point, example, point

Rehearse each piece separately. Start + end.
don't use canned jokes, prepped jokes. 

- focus on being a teacher. actionable takeaways

So, recently, I think I've become more critical about what people say and write. About the content that I'm consuming. 

It doesn't mean their opinions and claims are invalid. Or rather, I don't have a proper thinking and communication system to help me go through the points being made. 

I'm not even sure if I'm interpreting their points wrongly, through my personal filter about the subject matter 

Some things that comes into mind to research on includes

1. Logical Fallacies
2. How to ask questions
3. Debates
4. Persuasion
5. Misdirection

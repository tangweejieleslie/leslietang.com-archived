# Valuable Ideas
valuable, appealing ideas, that would attract viewers. i.e. VIEWS are the absolute metrics that will indicate which videos are doing well.

Concrete Steps
1. Create various videos, with different ideas
2. see which one performs best
3. Improve on the good performing videos

Common Mistake
- no subscribability factor


# Pick One Thing to Improve
After each video. improve by 1%. recall atomic habits.
Pay attention to the Average View Duration. The longer they stay, the better your content execution are.


# Enough Time
100 full effort videos, within 6 months to 2 years.

Metric to look out for, the baseline of views. i.e. average number of views are going up.

# Personal Thoughts
My first channel will be a throwaway channel. I will take 6 months to explore. Just try out various things. 
It's arrogant to assume that the first try will be successful. Life is not so straightforward, nor am I a genius. 

Channel Name: "Learning Random Stuffs"

Literally what I'll be doing now, learning, experimenting, simply trying a tons of things. 

## Publish Tempo

1. Publish short end results. Example. While learning about video edit, publish small snippets of editted sequences. 
2. At the end of each learning cycle, publish a summation video. 
	1. This is how I started
	2. This is what I improved
	3. This is my current process

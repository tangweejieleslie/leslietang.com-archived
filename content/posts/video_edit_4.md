This time round, I've started with the music. And indeed, the process flows much better. And it's more interesting to find clips that mesh an overarching narrative, that also fits the mood. 

Took 2 hours for this.
Total Experience: 6 hours. 

# Let the music guide the visuals 

I think this is the main takeaway from the past 4 days.

Another new thing that I've tried is the reversal of clips and adjusting the pace of clips. I don't think it's perfect, but I think it's a step forward. 

This time round, I've decided to let the music be the star. Or rather, I've forgotten about the sound effects -.-

I've also removed the constraints on the clip lengths. The constraint this time round, are the melodies flow. 

# Further Improvement
I think I'm quite happy with this video. I think the basics are ok. I think the next thing I want to work on, would be to come up with some form of storyline throughout the sequence. And maybe experiment with changing mood, e.g. have the music change from one mood to another. 

For the next video:
1. Storyline
2. Mood transition

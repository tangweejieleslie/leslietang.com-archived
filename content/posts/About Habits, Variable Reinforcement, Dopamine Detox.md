What make games addictive are the denial of rewards. How can we bring this to habits building and life in general?

Battle Royales are addictive due to the denial of rewards. Where you don't always win. Nothing to do with fun. 

Addiction Aspect
- playing although not having fun
- is due to addiction
- due to dopamine reinforcement circuitory 
- behavior reinforcement

This immediately refutes Atomic Habit's 4 steps framework. Does it?

Random Reinforcement Schedule is stronger than Fixed Reinforcement

Rewards/Motivation Drive and Hedonic Circuits are separate. (What are these?)

Reinforcing behavior and pleasure are two different circuits.

Once it becomes a habit, the reward/pleasure from it starts to decrease.
This reminds me of my friends who are still playing Summoners War.

Video games give pleasure + takes away pain from other parts of life.

What do you do about it?

Best way to start enjoying games -> Dopamine Detox. i.e. resetting those neurochemicals, etc. 
2 weeks cold turkey / abstinence . Basically.

Main enemy in dopamine detox, is boredom. Just need to survive 2 weeks of boredom.

# All of these are my personal opinions. 
> If you make investment decisions based on other people's opinions rather than your own formulated judgement, then it's a matter of time before the worst case scenario comes!


Read the news for facts, not opinions
Watch YouTube videos for facts, not opinions, not analysis.

# Have a clear exit strategy
1. If you believe the company you invested in is the market leader
	1. is there a new competitor coming?
	2. how long will it take the competitor to catch up?
2. Analysis based on consumer surplus
	1. Cost of Goods Sold
	2. Price of Product
	3. Value received
3. compare value brought to consumers across companies
4. consider the demand for the value
	1. marginal utility
5. Analysis based on network effect
	1. if the company simply continues what they are doing, will it become more difficult or more esay for competitors to penetrate the market? 
		1. e.g. if Palantir keeps building new and better data infrastructure, eventually it will be best position to serve most business' data requirements
			1.  when a company accumulates these pieces and systems, it will definitely miss out on edge cases and niche use case
			2.  a start up can overtake Palantir by zooming in to an unserved area
		2.  e.g. if Tesla keep building electric vehicle and keep innovating, the manufacturing processes will be more streamlined, there will be economies of scale, their AI could get more training data from each Tesla vehicle, they could become the market leader in geo related data applications
			1.  newcomers will find it difficult to compete against Tesla's EV
			2.  since Tesla is already innovating like a start up, a start up's usual tactics won't work as well. [insert all the references and evidence, and counter evidence]
		3.  NVIDIA
			1.  graphic card. AI

I like tech companies. I like data companies. Because they will gain network effects slowly, over time.

My portfolio is heavily concentrated. I wish I had made my own decision earlier. When I started out on my investment journey, one of the authors says they hated technology company. 

That book was written around dot com era. It's obvious why one would hate technology companies. 

# Technical Analysis
If you want to time the market to cash out some profits, that's fine. It's fun after all.

1. That's probably the only time you need technical analysis
	1. look at the chart patterns
	2. look at the buying and selling volume
	3. look at the various moving averages

I don't think it's possible to win all the time through technical analysis. That's why the fundamentals are important.

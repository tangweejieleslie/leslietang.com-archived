ikigai. a concept that I’ve heard of, but never truly looked into. Recently, this concept keeps catching my attention on my social media feed, so I decided to delve deeper into it.

Given how pervasive media is, the most common association with ikigai is probably the following Venn diagram:

The concept of ikigai, or rather the ideal that articles seems to focus on, is the achievement of “ikigai”. To achieve this ideal scenario, you would have to balance the four main factors (1) Your Strengths, (2) Your Passion, (3) Payment to You, (4) What the World Needs.

# Issue with this model

The first issue that comes into mind, is that there is no way, all of these 4 factors, would ever be constant. In other words, the ikigai that we seek, would always be _**changing**_.

What the **world needs** 20 years ago, would be largely different from what the world needs today. Likewise, it is likely to be different 20 years from now.

What you can be **paid for** 20 years ago, might become a commodity today. Likewise, what you are paid for today, might also become a commodity in 20 years.

And the thing that trouble me the most. What you are good at, and what you love.

This troubles me, simply because I **do not really have a “passion”**. I might have many interests, and might be curious about many things. But there isn’t really anything that I can say that I’m 100% passionate about.

Likewise, **what I am good** at is constantly changing. When I was working as an Analyst, my strengths lies in with data processing, analysis, data visualization, making data dashboard, data story telling and things like that.

After pivoting into software, my data related skillsets have rusted and my greater strengths lies in technical design, building tools, requirements analysis and software quality assurance.

# If everything is constantly changing, are we chasing a phantom?

The Venn diagram that illustrates the concept of ikigai, is a useful piece. But I think, it is incomplete. And what we need to be wary of, is applying an incomplete filter to the way we process new information.

I have no evidence of this. So I am merely guessing.

That there would be people who look at that diagram, follow some articles online, and start listing down all the things they can think of about for each of the parts in ikigai.

The question is, would they settle on one thing and decide that it is their ikigai? Or would they _**try**_ to settle on that one thing. Realize this isn’t really what they want. Give up. And form the conclusion that I am a failure. That I don’t have an ikigai.

# What’s the point of ikigai?

Lunch break is almost ending, so I’ll leave a few pointers for future research:

-   what are media portraying ikigai as?

-   how is the word, concept, originally used in Japan, amongst Japanese? because translation is a tricky business, and usually is influenced by the translators’ worldview

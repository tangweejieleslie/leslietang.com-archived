This time round, I tried creating a simple storyline. 

The concept is the "Morning before Work".

From the sunrise, to the preparation of the cafe. 

To the grabbing of breakfast. 

Though the time frame is the same, yet there exist 3 groups of people living very different lives.

The first group have some time to dine in the cafe. 
The second group have the luxury of working from home.
The last group is on the way to office.

The ending of the same sunrise is there to illustrate the concept of a short timeframe.

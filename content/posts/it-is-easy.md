It is easy to pivot into something with clear upsides. 

Imagine switching from an Analyst in the public sector into Tech in the private sector. 

The upside are obvious. 

- Tech is booming
- You are going into a rapidly growing company
- You are going into a place where you will work with and learn from some of the best engineers
- You get a significant salary jump

Best of all, there's not much downsides. 

- You'll need to put in the prep to get into the company
- You'll work longer hours, since it is competitive 
- It's a step out of your comfort zone

The downsides are mainly, you'll need to put a lot of effort. But I would say that applies to all endeavors worth pursuing.

The issue happens, when you are moving into something with more uncertainty. 
Maybe something like moving from a Tech job in a strong company into something like a start up. 

The potential upsides are huge, but it is uncertain if the upsides would be realized. 

In such cases, how do we make the decision to stay or to pursue the unknown? 

I think in such cases, we would need to go deeper into what we truly want?

Some common things that I want:
1. Time
2. Freedom (this is broad, but basically freedom to allocate my own resource, which includes time, brainpower, tasks that I choose to do. basically, freedom to make decisions)
3. Growth
4. Money

Some other things that people might want:
5. Relations
6. Security / Stability
7. Difficulty / Challenge (or the lack of)
8. Certainty
9. Career Progression
10. Work Life Balance
11. Prestige, Status

Impact Sizing through DIY Prototype
https://youtu.be/JI9qLSXEe94?t=1357

create a data prototype before any pitch, or proposal.
what user research can you incorporate

**Ruthless prioritization**: pick the things that will drives the most impact

Data will help you focus on the one thing

Just cause you are busy doing stuffs, doesn't means that you are making progress, nor growing

**Everything you push out, is an experiment** -> there's no certainty in life!

Knowns and Unknowns grid. 2x2. Knowledge about occurence and impact. 

## Crystal Clear Communication
communicate goal and vision, super clearly, to team and stakeholders

**you need to believe and have clarity about what the thing you are doing is!!!**



Dangers of being a Growth PM
- data is not the whole game, optimization is not the whole game. don't make optimization for the sake of optimizations! 
	- e.g. something that will drive metrics, but will not hinder experience
- good harts law. if metrics becomes goal, no longer a good metrics. cause you'll start optimizing for that


Growth teams are more common at start ups than big companies.
- big companies ends up growing organically?
- start up: acquisition and activation

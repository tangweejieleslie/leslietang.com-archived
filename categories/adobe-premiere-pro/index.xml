      <description>Second video sequence attempt: https://youtu.be/fcXv1gw3SHU
This time round it took about an hour.
Had remembered the mistake about sequence settings. This time round it&amp;rsquo;s a HD version. But had forgotten to set Codec, which slows down the rendering during edit.
Remember to Set Sequence Rendering Codec Experimented with Transitions. Movement and blur effects. It didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly went as I expected, nonetheless, it&amp;rsquo;s still an attempt. Would need to research more about transitions and adjustment layers.</description>

      <description>My first video sequence attempt, using Adobe Premiere Pro. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLrUc7GaoAA
Some of the challenges encountered.
1. Finding the appropriate clips The difficulty is finding the right clips that will express the ideas I have in mind.
I&amp;rsquo;ve also made a mistake on the sequence settings. Somewhere along the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve set the sequence to be 1280x720 instead of 1920x1080. It&amp;rsquo;s too much of a hassle to redo everyone on 1080p so I ended up uploading a 720p video.</description>

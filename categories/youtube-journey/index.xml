      <description>This video will be a summary of the lessons I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt from video edit. For the past 3 days. In the past 3 videos. 4 hours of lessons. Not that much. But 4 hours ahead of anyone who haven&amp;rsquo;t started.
1. Start from the music. It is a lot easier to make the clips fit the music. Compare to making the music fit the clips. If the music is a moody music, you can use LUTs to immediately apply a &amp;ldquo;moody&amp;rdquo; tone to all the clips.</description>

      <description>Setup The purpose is to set up the story. The wrap up of this part, is when the protaganist needs to make a decision.
Beginning The background, context.
Inciting Incident A single trigger that cause the start of the journey. A strong pain. A strong trigger. An event.
Basically, something happens and the underlying context is affected. The peace is disturbed. Or something like that.

      <description>Set Up. Why did I start learning about video editing?
 Seems fun It&amp;rsquo;s a core skill that would be useful for a YouTube channel I want to start a channel for the side income potential Video edit is the core part, which seems so daunting and difficult, so I wanted to try something low stakes and fun. Just to get a taste.  At the core of things, I just want to make money through side hustle, that is decoupled from my time.</description>
